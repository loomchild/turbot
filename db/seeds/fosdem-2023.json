In this session, we'll travel back in time to understand our rich journey so far, and look forward towards the future to reimagine a new world where openness and collaboration prevail. Come along and celebrate with us this very special moment!</p>",
      "description": "<p>The open source software label was coined at a strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California. That same month, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded as a general educational and advocacy organization to raise awareness and adoption for the superiority of an open development process. One of the first tasks undertaken by OSI was to draft the Open Source Definition (OSD). To this day, the OSD is considered a gold standard of open-source licensing.</p>\n\n<p>In this session, we'll cover the rich and interconnected history of the Free Software and Open Source movements, and demonstrate how, against all odds, open source has come to \"win\" the world. But have we really won? Open source has always faced an extraordinary uphill battle: from misinformation and FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) constantly being spread by the most powerful corporations, to issues around sustainability and inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>We'll navigate this rich history of open source and dive right into its future, exploring the several challenges and opportunities ahead, including its key role on fostering collaboration and innovation in emerging areas such as ML/AI and cybersecurity. We'll share an interactive timeline during the presentation and throughout the year, inviting the audience and the community at-large to share their open source stories and dreams with each other.</p>",

What started out as a hobby project (and to a certain degree still is) covers - peppered with a dash of humour - a wide variety of topics ranging from political and social to technology subjects; attracting key industry figures and projects including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation Europe, Mozilla's CTO, Nextcloud and BSD core devs to name but a few guests on the show so far.</p>\n\n<p>The talk gives an overview of the history of the podcast since its creation followed by a discussion of the general approach, the philosophy behind the format and its organisation. A section on the technology stack that drives the highly automated workflow behind the scenes will be of interest not only for buddying fellow podcasters but anybody concerned with media production and distribution in general. In addition, the hosts will shed some light on the challenges we have faced over the years and how these were overcome. The talk concludes with a discussion of the road ahead for the Inlaws and their next twenty years (if not more :-) of making a difference in the community and beyond.</p>",

From the avatars to a personal collection of pictures, the platform holds the responsibility of removing the violating content.\nThe problem can be tackled with clssifiers, human moderators and by comparing media signatures; this presentation will be about the latter.\nSimilarity Detection is an approach that tries to detect media based on an archive of \"definitions\" (yes, like the antiviruses) of things that have already been classified as violating.\nBut how do we measure similarity between images from the perspective of a machine (not to mention video/audio clips of different lenghts)? The answer is not MD5...\nWe'll talk how we do it, what technologies you can use too and how we can leverage a public, crowdsourced archive of signatures to defeat various threats, from terrorism to misinformation to Child Exploitation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>LF Research was founded on a track record of excellence in research led by the Linux Foundation, on topics such as exploring the Kernel at 30, or the FOSS Contributor Survey in partnership with the Laboratory of Innovation Science at Harvard. Since its launch in April, 2021, Linux Foundation Research has published two dozen reports based on empirical methodologies that describe open source as a paradigm for mass collaboration at scale. LF Research projects fall into four frameworks: industry vertical analysis, technology horizontal analysis, geographic/regional analysis, and ecosystem analysis, for research projects that span all industries, technologies, and regions. It has become a mechanism through which the open source community can share feedback and perspectives in an open and transparent way. Among the early reports published was Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Source: Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities to Create Agency and Equity Across Open Source Ecosystems. This report and others in financial services, film and entertainment, SBOMs, and cybersecurity, identify developer and contributor experiences, motivations, and priorities among other trends and key findings, specifically when it comes to securing software supply chains. This talk will identify what developers and contributors have said they experience, need, and want most across numerous LF Research studies, identify opportunities for the audience to access open datasets, and how to become further involved in the research process.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Modern systems have come a long way from waking up every 16 milliseconds to peek and poke into a framebuffer which was directly displayed to the user. A single image frame may begin in a camera, be pushed through an image signal processor, be sent through several layers of web browser for processing and using the GPU to add funny hats, then be sent simultaneously to a media codec to send to your friends, as well as onwards through the window system to your display controller, possibly with colour correction, alpha blending, and more, along the way. These systems are every bit as complex as they are poorly understood. In this talk, Daniel will attempt to answer all the questions you never knew you had, such as: is GBM really the Generic Buffer Manager? What's wrong with fbdev? How do I even allocate buffers? Why won't Wayland give me 1000fps on glxgears? If GPUs are so very fast, why does everyone tell me I can't use them because they're slow? And what do these window system people even do all day, anyway? The talk is aimed at anyone who wishes they understood the complexity of modern display pipelines, plans for future development, and how to develop applications &amp; products that use the full capability of modern hardware at maximum effectiveness.</p>",

      "subtitle": "The state of free and open source silicon",
      "abstract": "<p>Free and open source silicon, the art and craft of making computer chips with (only) free tools, has come a long way -- and has now reached the magic threshold where it can't be ignored any more. In this talk, we'll do a fast-paced journey through what's needed to go from an idea for a silicon chip to actually producing a real physical one using free and open source tools and building blocks. And since talk is cheap, we'll actually build a chip design during the talk in a live demo. Join to learn more about what's possible today, how free and open source is permeating the established industry, and how you can get involved as well.</p>",
      "description": "<p>In the last decades, producing a \"real\" silicon chip was an effort that required a large-ish team, a fair amount of money, and inside knowledge that only a small, selected group of individuals and companies had. That has changed: free and open source silicon is here, and it democratizes access to chip design for anyone. Free tools in all areas of chip design, from simulation to synthesis and physical design, have attracted renewed attention and are at a point where they are powerful enough to be used for actual chip tapeouts. The last barrier of entry for prospective chip designers fell with the announcement of the SkyWater PDK two years ago: real-world design rules, required to manufacture chips, are now freely available as well.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we'll look at the open source silicon ecosystem: which tools do we have available, how are they working together in a toolflow, and can all of that be combined to produce a working chip?</p>\n\n<p>Open source software has irrevocably changed the way software is developed. Open source silicon is set to do the same: inject new life into the traditionally closed chip development ecosystem, combining ideas from the open source software world with the accumulated wisdom of seasoned hardware engineers.</p>",

For several years, Fedora had YUM, which became DNF eleven years ago. Now, DNF5 will replace DNF and be the new Fedora standard.\nIn this talk, we will give an introduction to DNF5. We aim to address our new design principles and how our choices fix some of DNF's design flaws. We will present a live demo of the new product to showcase some features of DNF5 and make comparisons with DNF. Lastly, we will cover our plan to improve communication, inclusion, and openness with the open-source community.</p>",
      "description": "<p>It is public knowledge that the DNF codebase became cluttered and, at times, substandard, cutting off a large slice of the open-source community from participating in the development process and decision-making process. Likewise, historical design decisions held DNF back from evolving into a modern and sustainable package manager.\nWe want to answer how certain design issues were addressed, and why the structure of DNF5 impacts environments such as the desktop, containers, and CI.\nMoreover, we will go over the user experience of our command-line interface in the live demonstration, with some examples of common use cases and a speed comparison of processing commands between DNF and DNF5.\nLastly, we will discuss how DNF5 enables us to work closer with the community. A thoroughly documented codebase, transparent upstream issue tracking, and open feature planning and delivery are all requirements that we intend to fulfill.\nOur target audience is people with some degree of expertise in package management or who are proficient using DNF.</p>",

And this cutting-edge work will soon extend to 5 axis FDM.</p>\n\n<p>Kiri:Moto runs both online and offline (as a progressive web app) in standard browsers as well as mobile devices and tablets. It pushes the boundaries of what's possible inside the browser sandbox using web workers for distributed computing, WASM for accelerated computation, and ThreeJS for visualization.</p>\n\n<p>The active base of users skews toward college and high-school classrooms, maker-spaces, and individual creators.

      "abstract": "<p>Passwordless authentication is making a lot noise. Use of FIDO2/WebAuthn tokens and other passwordless means to login to web services is all the rage but there isn't that much available to make the technology usable without troubles for 'traditional' Linux systems, locally and remotely.</p>\n\n<p>For past several years FreeIPA and SSSD teams have been working on enabling end to end passwordless access in centralized and local environment, be it corporate or home deployment. This talk will go into details of our progress in passwordless access implementation for Linux systems.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022 FreeIPA project introduced ability to authenticate users against OAuth2 identity providers (IdPs). This functionality allows to obtain Kerberos credentials after authentication and authorization has been done by the external IdP. As many OAuth2 IdPs allow passwordless authentication with WebAuthn tokens, a true passwordless transition across Linux systems is now available, from login to console, raising privileges within PAM services (e.g. sudo access), to accessing remote systems over SSH. We hope to expand this support with native FIDO2/WebAuthn integration as well.</p>\n\n<p>The work is not complete yet and needs a lot of collaboration across multiple open source projects. Come to this talk to see a demo and discuss how we can improve our passwordless experience together.</p>",

From technology monoliths to universities to governments, the number of âopen source developersâ has increased, and with it, open source software. It is no secret that Open Source has âwon,â according to many. However, despite the sheer scale of FOSS development today, has the form much of our FOSS infrastructure has taken benefited all in the ways that we expect?</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I will take participants on a journey through the history of labor in FOSS development to better understand the political economy of FOSS development and what it means for individual FOSS contributors. This talk will use economic analysis to bring up many inspiring steps forward we have taken and also raise many worrying questions about the software we are building.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The contents of this talk will be based on the 2021 research paper âThe Evolution of Open Source: Winners and losers in volunteer production,â which can be found at the following DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/4CHFN. This paper discusses the material history of FOSS and provides an economic analysis of how labor is the primary means of control of FOSS rather than copyright. Therefore institutions that control significant amounts of labor through the hiring and coercion of workers can dictate the primary benefits of FOSS infrastructure in many of the same ways one could through utilizing copyright.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Algorithm for fair multithreaded task scheduler for languages like C, C++, C#, Rust, Java. C++ version is open-sourced. Features: (1) formally verified in TLA+, (2) even CPU usage across worker threads, (3) coroutine-like functionality, (4) almost entirely lock-free, (5) up to 10 million RPS per thread.</p>",
      "description": "<p>\"Task scheduling\" essentially means asynchronous execution of callbacks, functions. Some kind of a \"scheduler\" is omnipresent in most services - an event loop; a thread-pool for blocking requests; a coroutine engine - you name it. Scheduler is an important basis on top of which the serviceâs logic can be built.</p>\n\n<p>Gamedev is no exception. I work at Ubisoft - we have miles of code used in thousands of servers, mostly C++. There is a vast deal of task types to execute: download a save, send a chat message, join a clan, etc. Often they compose one multi-step task: (1) take a profile lock, (2) download a save, (3) free the lock, (4) respond to the player. Between each step there is a waiting time until the operation is done.</p>\n\n<p>One of the game enginesâ backend code had a simple scheduler generic enough to be used for every async job in all servers. It juggled tasks across several internal worker threads. But it had the following typical issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Unfairness. Tasks were distributed to worker threads in a round-robin. If tasks differ in duration, some threads can appear choking while others are idle.</p></li>\n<li><p>Polling. In a naive scheduler multi-step task execution works via periodic wakeup of the task. When awake, the task checks if the current step is done and if it can go to the next one. With many thousands of tasks this polling eats notably more CPU than the actual workload.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The talk presents a new highly efficient general purpose threaded task scheduler algorithm, which solves these problems and achieves even more:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complete fairness - even CPU usage across worker threads and no task pinning;</li>\n<li>Coroutine-like - API to wake a task up on a deadline and for immediate wakeup;</li>\n<li>No contention - operation is mostly built on lock-free algorithms;</li>\n<li>Formal correctness - the scheduler is formally verified in TLA+;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>After the scheduler was implemented in C++ and embedded into several highly loaded servers, it gave N-fold improvement of both RPS and latency (more than x10 speed up for one server).</p>\n\n<p>At the same time the talk is not C++-specific. It is rather a presentation of several algorithms combined in the scheduler. They can be implemented in many languages: at least C, C++, Rust, Java, C#. Only need support of atomics and threads.</p>\n\n<p>All that is completely open source - https://github.com/ubisoft/task-scheduler.</p>",

In recent years the Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make (PRIMM) approach has been proposed to help students by focusing on learning how to read code before moving on to learning how to write it.</p>\n\n<p>In this lightning talk we will discuss how open source micromaterials can be created as small side or hobby projects, taking into consideration these concepts.

      "abstract": "<p>We are developing an open source federatable management system for FabLabs, Makerspaces and Hackerspaces. FabAccess aims to manage access to machines in order to avoid accidents.\nFabAccess has three main functionalities:\n- Machine management\n- Authorization system\n- User management</p>",
      "description": "<h2>Machine management</h2>\n\n<p>We want to combine Neil Gershenfeld's idea of users learning to operate machines independently with the requirements of open workshops that users do not injure themselves in the process. Thus, users need instruction for dangerous machines, and this principle is then reflected in the authorization system.</p>\n\n<p>The principle of FabAcces is to switch machines on and off via the power connection or via internal firmware. This way, machines are normally de-energized and therefore harmless. Only when users are at the machine who are competent and instructed for safe operation, the machine gets connected to the power supply by FabAccess.</p>\n\n<p>The management of machines that require cleaning after use is supported, either. This ensures the usability of machines for the next user and reduces wear and tear.</p>\n\n<p>We also support the reservation of machines, but we do not want to take over scheduling for the users. Therefore, as a compromise we implement that users can reserve machine only for half an hour (as a modifiable parameter). So they don't have to worry about someone else using the machine while they commute to the FabLab.</p>\n\n<h2>Authorization system</h2>\n\n<p>The authorization system makes it possible to allow access to machines only for certain users. Thus, it can be used to map instructions for dangerous machines, but more complex mappings are possible due to the high configurability of the RBAC system (role-based access system).</p>\n\n<p>It is also possible to map simple machines that do not require instruction but need to be used in a somehow structured way (workplaces, tools, lockers, ..).</p>\n\n<h2>User management</h2>\n\n<p>The user administration should make it possible not to lose track of the users in the space. FabAccess is intended to be used as a SmartCard system, so each user receives an NXP Mifare DESFire (FabCard) card to authenticate himself at the machine.</p>\n\n<p>In order to reduce the administrative effort, users can register on their own and can then be activated after the operator has checked their data. The user contract is mapped in the process and may be integrated into other systems.</p>",

Improved reliability, decreased time to production, increased stability, and all of this without sacrificing usability or end-user experience.</p>",
      "description": "<p>At the outset of the project, the existing fleet deployment and management systemsâwhich had grown organically over the previous yearsâwere in need of an upgrade. We embarked on a new initiative with an aim to reduce the time to deployment, increase the reliability of those deployments, and improve the maintainability of the management infrastructure as a whole. Leveraging PXE, Ansible, chroot, DHCP, and a clean monorepo backend, we were ultimately able to scale the number of managed machines by orders of magnitudeâwithout linearly scaling the time or resource commitments for the sysadmins. In this talk, weâll look at architectures, code examples, decision trees, challenges, and solutions. At the end of the session, the audience will have a better understanding of not only the technologies involved, but also the business cases behind those choices.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>At a time where make was developed, a simple and computationally cheap solution\nto the problem of how to handle the relation between artifacts and files was\nneeded. Each artifact is associated with a file in the filesystem and the\ntimestamp of the file was used to determine which actions (recipes) need to be\nexecuted. Traditionally, to be backwards compatible with make, subsequent build\nsystems also implemented this concept. However, there is no technical reason to\ndo it like this. Instead, it even has a couple of advantages if this concept is\nabandoned and no association of artifacts with the filesystem is done. Nowadays,\nwhere content-addressable storage is a widely applied concept and actions are\nanyway executed in an isolated environment may it be in a separate directory or\nin a sandbox, this problem can be tackled by a complete separation between\nphysical and logical paths, which is also called staging. Input and output paths\nof an individual action are abstracted away. Thus, each target has its own view\nof the world and can place generated artifacts at any logical path they like.\nConsuming targets may place these generated artifacts at a different logical\nlocation. This allows to define build targets independently of their actual\nlocation and in particular allows to refer to targets from other repositories.\nThis simplifies the handling of different repositories. All what matters is how\nthe target is defined and not where. This concept is implemented in an\nopen-source build system, which is publicly available under the following link:\nhttps://github.com/just-buildsystem/justbuild.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Sovereign Cloud Stack combines the best of Cloud Computing in one unified standard. SCS is built, backed, and operated by an active open-source community worldwide. As only the sum of different repositories complete the SCS Stack, it is important to have an easy and accessible documentation of the SCS Project in one place. In this talk you will be taken on our journey on how we have developed a low invasive workflow to bring together all individual docs to a unified collection that is being generated to single page application using docusaurus. A journey that takes us from a mere collection of markdown documents to a meaningful information architecture. With this talk we not only want to convey our story but invite you to feedback your experiences with such endeavours.</p>",

In this talk we will look at the history of how the impact of Cloud on Open Source changed through the years, examine the current state as well as make a case for a particular way to use Cloud and Open Source Together. If you cherish the values of Open Source - you will do well by using Cloud as Commodity Infrastructure Provider and run Open Source Software on top of it. Consider Kubernetes in particular as your API of choice with its ubiquitous availability among all major public cloud providers and private cloud software vendors. We will show what while this ecosystem may not be as mature as proprietary solution from cloud vendors it is moving rapidly and becoming a great fit for more and more situations.</p>",

For the success of such initiatives, it is fundamental to learn from the past and understand how a modern on-premise data center would be structured.\nI started working in 2004 when almost everything was on-premise, and I had a front-row seat to the migrations that occurred in this period thanks to my roles as a Systems and Solutions Architect.\nIn this talk, we will recap the last twenty years of migrations to learn some key lessons, and then we will analyze what a modern on-premise data center would look like, which technologies might help and which could be risky bets.</p>",

      "description": "<p>In the latest years, the subject of European Digital Sovereignty is gaining ground. Clearly the dominant position of the BigTechs is making both European companies, Countries but also individual increasingly dependent on the product and services of the BigTechs. In order to regain our sovereignty we need to look at the full stack, from hardware, to cloud and to the software running on those hardware and clouds.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I would like to present the importance of the core Collaborative Softwares using by individuals and companies in this stack and the progress and challenges of the Open Source communities providing alternative solutions and the importance of all European countries to collectively support the actors in the Open Source communities providing solution in this area.</p>\n\n<p>I will show the progress made in the last years by different providers of Open Source solutions (NextCloud, Matrix, BigBlueButton, Jitsi, XWiki, CryptPad and many others), describe the challenges and difficulties when building Open Source products and competing with the extremely powerful actors that we are facing (including monopoly abuses), but also make proposals on how we could make them work better together.</p>",

The Alliance brings together relevant stakeholders from the private and public sector to jointly define strategic investment roadmaps to enable the next generation of highly-secure, distributed, interoperable, and resource-efficient sovereign cloud and edge technologies. This talk will provide a summary of the role that open source plays in the EU technological roadmap that the Alliance will be publishing by the end of January 2023, and will explore the different ways in which collaboration around open source technologies can contribute to building a future European sovereign cloud.</p>",

My hope is that by bringing a better set of controls to a node, I can unlock brilliant higher order distributed systems in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Aurae takes ownership of all runtime processes on a single piece of hardware like systemd, and provides mTLS encrypted gRPC APIs (Aurae Standard Library) to manage the processes. Aurae has a new style of isolation called \"Aurae Cells\" that manage cgroups and namespaces directly from pid1. With Aurae Cells the project offers a way to slice up a system using various isolation strategies for enterprise workloads including MicroVMs.</p>\n\n<p>Learn about 3 specific parts of the project and how they influenced the decision to move to Rust.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Managing cgroups (v1/v2) directly with Rust, and how kata containers and systemd influenced the container runtime module.</li>\n<li>mTLS encrypted gRPC with tonic and rustls.

      "abstract": "<p>We present BastionLab, a Rust open-source privacy framework for confidential data science collaboration.\nWe aim to help data owners open access to their datasets to outside data scientists. The current approaches, such as opening Jupyter notebooks, provide no elaborate control over what is shared. Datasets can easily be extracted from them, which means they offer little privacy guarantees and make data collaboration difficult.</p>\n\n<p>BastionLab provides an interactive interface for data scientists to explore remote datasets, yet answers the privacy concerns of data owners, as only results compliant with the privacy policy defined by the data owners can be communicated.</p>\n\n<p>Data exposure is limited as data scientists never have direct access to the data, they can only use a limited set of operators which preclude arbitrary code execution to exfiltrate data, and a strict access control policy is put in place. Differential Privacy and Trusted Execution Environments are supported as well to ensure maximum privacy.\nWe will provide an example to show how a COVID dataset could be shared to a remote data scientist to perform data exploration, cleaning and visualization, while making sure only anonymized results are communicated.\nThe server side of BastionLab is developed in Rust for its memory safety, performance and community. It allows the use of cutting-edge libraries like polars, an open source DataFrame library in Rust several times faster than pandas, the go-to solution in Python.</p>",

There is an ongoing drive to support compiling Rust code in a way that can make use of these extensions.</p>\n\n<p>Doing this provides another layer of protection. We can encode knowledge about provenance validity, bounds and other access restrictions that the compiler (and OS/etc.) knows about in a way the hardware can enforce at runtime. The Rust memory model is famous for being able to enforce these types of restrictions at compile time, but not for unsafe Rust code. Unsafe Rust code needs to be written sometimes, which presents situations which can only be verified at run time. Some other nice benefits could come from this work. For example, runtime bounds checking can now be done by hardware rather than software, and since provenance information is necessary for operations on capabilities, closing gaps where it is not currently preserved forms a part of this work.</p>\n\n<p>This talk is a discussion on what is required for this support, and gives an overview of the state of the various attempts to implement this support.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Efficient In-Memory Adaptive Stable Sorting on Modern Hardware",
      "abstract": "<p>Sorting is one of the most common algorithms used in programming, and virtually every standard library contains a routine for it. Despite also being one of the oldest problems out there, surprisingly large improvements are still being found. Some of these are fundamental novelties, and others are optimizations matching the changing performance landscape in modern hardware.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we present Glidesort, a general purpose in-memory stable comparison sort. It is fully adaptive to both pre-sorted runs in the data similar to Timsort, and low-cardinality inputs similar to Pattern-defeating Quicksort, making it to our knowledge the first practical stable sorting algorithm fully adaptive in both measures. Glidesort achieves a 3x speedup over a Rustâs standard library Timsort routine on sorting random 32-bit integers, with the speedup breaking the order of magnitude barrier for realistic low-cardinality distributions. It achieves this without the use of SIMD, processor-specific intrinsics or assumptions about the type being sorted: it is a fully generic sort taking an arbitrary comparison operator.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Using Glidesort as the motivating example we discuss the principles of efficient stable in-memory partitioning and merging on modern hardware. In particular attention is paid to eliminating branches and interleaving independent parallel loops to efficiently use our modern deeply-pipelined superscalar processors. The lessons learned here are widely applicable to efficient data processing outside of sorting.</p>\n\n<p>We also go into more detail on the various intricacies that Glidesort has to overcome in our Rust implementation. In particular how to deal with splitting and concatenating slices in a safe manner using GhostCell-style branding, the problems faced when dealing with panics in the comparison operator, and potential issues with interior mutability in comparison operators.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Graphs are used in many different applications as they are an intuitive way for representing complex relationships between entities, as for example in social, communication, financial or geographical networks. Graphs in these domains can be very large, potentially spanning multiple millions and even billions of nodes and edges. In order to get analytical insights out of these structures, scalable implementations of graph algorithms are necessary. Rust is the ideal language for implementing such algorithms, due to its well-known aspects, such as \"fearless concurrency\" and memory safety as well as its great out-of-the-box performance and its expressive type system.</p>\n\n<p>In our presentation, we will talk about the \"graph\" project, a collection of open source crates that we are working on. The project includes an in-memory graph representation, APIs for building in-memory graphs from various data sources, and a small collection of high-performance graph algorithms. In addition to these building blocks, we started developing a Python wrapper called graph-mate for a NetworkX-like experience and an Apache Arrow endpoint for integrating the project in distributed applications. The presentation will include a project overview, a walk through the Rust API, and a demo for using the project via Python.</p>",

We explain patterns that we used to make it possible to fine tune the requested (optional) features while providing a safe default behavior. For simple use cases, the idea is to provide a best-effort security approach for potentially unsupported kernel features: use available features and ignore others.

It consists in a server, running on a computer, acting as the attester, and a graphical client application, running on a trusted phone, acting as the verifier.</p>\n\n<p>A typical use-case is to verify the integrity of your bootchain before unlocking your computer, to prevent offline attacks on an unattended laptop. It can also serve as a debugging tool for secure boot issues after firmware upgrades or as a second factor for disk encryption.</p>",
      "description": "<p>During the boot of a PC, it is now common to have each stage store measurements of the next one into a TPM, in order to keep a tamper-proof log of the boot chain. Those measurements are then leveraged to seal secrets, eg. a disk encryption key, or to report the state of the device to a remote server in cryptographically secure way, using a procedure known as remote attestation.</p>\n\n<p>Remote attestation has slowly gained traction over the last few years, most notably among cloud providers such as Azure, to guard access to online resources. It is also a key element in validating dynamic root-of-trust measurements (DRTM), which reduce the trusted computing base compared to traditional UEFI-based boot chains, but require a trusted third-party to validate the final state of the system. Unfortunately, little progress has been made recently to enable individual users without access to server resources to reap the benefits of remote attestation. This is particularly frustrating considering that almost everybody carries a small trusted server with them all the time: smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>Building upon an idea by Matthew Garrett (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FobfM9S9xSI\">Linux Conference Australia, 2020</a>), we introduce Ultrablue (User-friendly Lightweight TPM Remote Attestation over Bluetooth), a solution to securely inspect and validate a TPM event log from a phone. Ultrablue consists of a command-line attester, running on a computer, and an Android graphical application, running on a trusted phone, communicating over encrypted Bluetooth low-energy (BLE). Pairing the phone and computer is made easier and more secure through the use of a QR Code. After a trust-on-first-use provisioning phase to enroll the computer on the phone, the phone can check that the boot chain has not been compromised in later boots. Sample scripts and a self-contained virtual machine are also provided as a reference of how to integrate Ultrablue in the boot process to guard disk encryption by a secret delivered by the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Future work includes improving the user interface to inspect and validate unexpected event logs, adding support for more versatile verification policies, and integrating Ultrablue into existing hardened systems such as Safeboot (safeboot.net).</p>\n\n<p>The Ultrablue project has been developped at ANSSI (https://ssi.gouv.fr) by LoÃ¯c Falkau--Buckwell, under the supervision of Nicolas Bouchinet and Gabriel Kerneis.</p>",

Machine OS leverages opensource tools\nfor building (project-stacker), signing (notary/cosign) and hosting\n(project-zot) such images.  The design of Machine OS has some similarities\nwith the UAPI proposal for Trusted/SecureBoot, making for an interesting\ncomparison on design goals.</p>\n\n<p>Our design is focused around the goal not of preventing alternative boot\nimages, but denying all images which are not verified access to a set of\nTPM-protected secrets.  Furthermore, to support re-use of a single signed UKI\nby multiple unrelated projects, image manifests are signed by product\ncertificates which are all signed by one company-wide CA, whose certificate is\nshipped as part of the (protected) UKI.</p>",

May it be e.g. technical new devices like mobile/tablets or online apps or may it be motivations changing from cost arguments to a gain on digital sovereignty for example, all these new developments should be covered by state of the art migrations.

There I explained in detail the past, common and possible future graphics subsystems for LibreOffice. One aspect of this is the transition/escape path to get to new shores and allow to let old stuff completely behind, so reaching new shores.\nWhen I prepared that talk I started to implement a complete and working example how to do system-specific PrimitiveRenderers. I promised to continue and finish that in my private time, so I managed to get a working version. In this talk/presentation I want to talk about the process, what experiences I made to create the example, about upstream stuff that had to be done in master to prepare the ground for others and about the state of affairs.\nI will also make a short presentation/comparison with a version of the office that uses that new technic with the current one to present made achievements.</p>",

Additionally, bringing new products to the hands of users is happening much faster than before, making Continuous Delivery a critical aspect of doing business. The way we do business is evolving at a tremendous pace and keeping up with the technology and tooling can often put strains on companies regardless of size or number of employees. Knowing where to start is one issue but then once youâve started how do you scale. Do you need more tools, which tools do you need, what resources do you have to help you pick the right path to keep your company running efficiently, how do you train your developers while they continue to do their day jobs? The CD Foundation was formed and incubates projects that address these challenges in an open-source, vendor-neutral manner.</p>\n\n<p>Using best practices from graduated projects like Jenkins and Tekton as well as incubating projects like CDEvents and Spinnaker, the CD Foundation is working on the CD Reference Architecture to help take the guesswork out of tooling and scaling and creating a blueprint on how to establish, structure or modernise your CI/CD infrastructure. This talk will go over some examples of the CD Reference Architecture and resources available to help make CD accessible for your organisation.</p>",

Writing crossplane compositions is not always easy and testing them with all possible combinations and outcomes is even harder. It requires a lot of effort to make sure all components are deployed correctly and work as expected â especially if you have a lot of them. Since everything is written in YAML and crossplane is a relatively new technology, there is no standard set of tools to test everything yet.</p>\n\n<p>To test our compositions automatically, we have set up a CI pipeline that consists of two test stages: A static code analysis using our self-written linter for Crossplane that runs various checks, like ensuring that all patches are pointing to an existing resource property. The second stage consists of end-to-end tests built with Kuttl and compares the status of real provisioned infrastructure with the expected outcome.</p>",

Both canary deployments and feature flags are typically used to implement Progressive Delivery at both application and operational service levels.</p>\n\n<p>Teams collaborate with a DevOps philosophy and a \"you build it, you run it\" approach, with freedom, but also requiring tooling to help teams deliver value with the least interference as possible.

Specifically, it shows how you can use this framework and creates a policy that changes the SDS load dynamically so it can mitigate effects such as noisy neighbors and faulty network devices (NICs or ToR switch) without moving data around. This can be very useful when the effects described are temporary (for example noisy neighbor in hyper-converged environment)</p>",
      "description": "<p>The new balancer is based on a policy that defines the desired primary configuration and the engine that changes the configuration to meet the desired configuration (or at least be as close to it as possible). The engine is fast and involves no data movement (only metadata changes). As a result, it can be executed periodically over relatively short periods. Given this feature, anyone can write policies that react to changes in the cluster behavior in near real time. We will show some use cases and the logic to build policies that maximize the cluster performance for these use cases.</p>",

Although focused to work on top of Longhorn (https://longhorn.io), s3gw can leverage any local filesystem or Persistent Volume provided to it. The project is divided in two main components: the s3gw service, a Ceph RADOS Gateway with a custom, filesystem based backend, leveraging RGW's SAL implementation; and the s3gw UI, not only for management tasks but also providing a bucket and object explorer.\nDuring our time together we will discuss s3gw's backend implementation, and present the UI, with a small demonstration of how to deploy the project on a small kubernetes cluster. With this talk we would love to also gather feedback from the attendees, so we can feed back into project development.</p>",

We show how autoscaling is\nimpacting the performance and resource utilization in the environment by taking Cephâs object store frontend (the\nRADOS Gateway daemon) as a use case.\nWe will demonstrate how to use KEDA and Prometheus to solve a scaling problem that cannot be quickly resolved by\nthe traditional HPA (horizontal pod autoscaling). We will show how the Rook operator orchestrates the different\nparts of the system. Attendees will learn how to use cloud-native tools to perform autoscaling, better utilize\nresources like CPU and I/O and increase the performance of their solutions.</p>",

The differences vary in different amounts depending on each subsystem, bus, kernel API, etc.\nThis presentation will illustrate the situation with a few examples, and work as a call for volunteers from every BSD project. The goal is to explore areas where more code can be shared among the different BSDs, with a focus on device drivers. Generally, good ideas deserve a chance to be visible across the different systems!</p>",

      "subtitle": "A BSD/LLVM distro from scratch",
      "abstract": "<p>Chimera Linux is a new Linux distribution started in mid-2021. It's a general-purpose operating system based on binary packages that aims to be practical and clean, while addressing various shortcomings of an average Linux distro. One of the things making it unique is that it's a non-GNU distribution, utilizing a combination of userland utilities originating from FreeBSD, the LLVM/Clang toolchain and musl libc, besides other things. On top of that, it is not based on any existing distribution and comes with its own packaging infrastructure and various custom software that was needed to fill in the gaps. It's also highly portable, already supporting x86_64, POWER, AArch64 and RISC-V, with more possibly coming. In the presentation I will cover the progress made in the last year, as well as give a general overview of the system and what it takes to create a distro from scratch.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The distribution follows a rolling release model and by default uses the GNOME desktop with Wayland. The custom package building infrastructure was created after having learned from the shortcomings of equivalent systems in other distros, aiming to be flexible and fast, while emphasizing correctness and allowing for fully sandboxed, unprivileged builds. The result is binary packages/repositories for apk-tools, which Chimera uses as a frontend package manager. The build tooling can also bring the system up from source using a foreign musl-based distribution as a base, making it easily bootstrappable. The resulting repositories utilize LLVM's ThinLTO for nearly all packages, and special emphasis is also placed on security hardening (including CFI and others). Service management is based on the Dinit suite with a custom set of core services and is fully supervising, dependency-based and aims to provide practical parity with systemd, while remaining lean and grokkable (and most importantly, portable). A major aspect of the project is to also improve software portability across the stack, improving the state of matters for both Linux and the BSDs. We also aim to contribute code improvements back to FreeBSD.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, this is not any kind of dogmatic, niche effort. It's a system that tries to be pragmatic, providing a complete package that is polished and has well-defined defaults, while establishing its own identity and not being like something else. We also want to establish a community that is open and welcoming, without pointless elitism, and most importantly have fun doing all of this.</p>\n\n<p>This is a follow-up presentation to last year's FOSDEM, but I will try my best to make it standalone and as easy to understand as possible for the general audience. Some basic Linux administration knowledge may be necessary for some of the information.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Compiler-rt is a set of runtime routines present in LLVM infrastructure to support and provide an implementation of various builtin functions for multiple architectures. It consists of â builtin libraries, sanitizer runtimes, profile runtimes, and block runtimes. This talk focuses on one of the compiler rt components- sanitizers. Compiler-rt sanitizers are used to perform runtime checks on compiled code. These checks can include detecting and preventing common programming errors, such as buffer overflows and memory leaks, as well as more sophisticated checks, such as undefined behavior sanitization, which can help detect and prevent subtle bugs that can be difficult to find using other methods. This talk will provide an introduction to compiler rt sanitizers in LLVM, and how to use them on various architectures starting with an example of memory sanitizer for x86 architecture. Second part of the talk will cover â how compiler-rt sanitizers can be used for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architecture and integrate in development and testing using Software development kit (SDK) built with Yocto. Also useful for the development of applications for memory-constrained embedded devices using clang and LLVM.</p>",

However, getting started with creating your own IR, called dialect in the MLIR universe, is sometimes tricky. This tutorial addresses some of the challenges arising with the CMake configuration and explores projects like the standalone MLIR dialect example in more detail. Furthermore, we take a look at how TableGen files that define a single dialect can be split.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Even with tutorials on MLIR like the MLIR tutorial presented at the LLVM Developers' Meeting in 2020 [1] and the \"Creating a Dialect\" [2] as well as the Toy tutorial [3] in the MLIR docs, building an MLIR dialect can feel difficult. This can be especially the case when it comes to the CMake configuration. Good starting points are the standalone MLIR dialect example [4] and especially the tutorial [5] given by S. Neuendorffer at last years LLVM Developers' Meeting.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the existing tutorials, we will look into the details of the CMake configuration of an out-of-tree dialect like [4]. Furthermore, we dive into more complex CMake configurations for projects like MLIR-EmitC [6], showing how to build a project standalone or embedded into another project. In addition to the CMake configuration, it is briefly covered how to architecture TableGen files. In particular, it is shown how to use multiple TableGen files to define a single dialect, e.g. to define the base dialect, operations, attributes and types.</p>\n\n<p>[1] M. Amini &amp; R.

      "abstract": "<p>Open-source tools based on LLVM that target rich software platforms such as Linux are in widespread use. A large proportion of the investment in upstream LLVM development is targeted at this use case. There is much less use of open-source C/C++ toolchains for embedded software development, with GCC toolchains being dominant. This can be explained by a number of factors:\n* Assembling an embedded toolchain is complicated, due to cross-compilation and missing components such as the C-library.\n* Differences in the toolchain interface and missing functionality compared to GCC.\n* Code-size and performance gaps on embedded targets.</p>\n\n<p>There are efforts in the LLVM community to improve the suitability for embedded software development. This presentation will cover some of the gaps and what we are trying to do to fill them. Specifically:\n* Hosted versus embedded toolchains.\n* Why do we want to use LLVM for an embedded toolchain?\n* What components make up an embedded toolchain, and which of these can be supplied by the LLVM project.\n* The LLVM bare metal driver.\n* A comparison of a LLVM based toolchain against an equivalent GNU toolchain.\n* Work that is being done in the community to improve embedded development.\n* How to get involved!</p>",
      "description": "<p>The presentation does not require any in depth knowledge of LLVM or compilers. An awareness of the components of a toolchain such as compiler, linker and libraries will be helpful. The toolchains used for comparison are the LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm and the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.</p>\n\n<p>Details of LLVM community meet-ups, including the Monthly LLVM Embedded Toolchains call are available at https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html</p>",

We already decided to set this format Open Source. In parallel, SBB has developed a Viewing software for this data format, called RCM-DX Viewer. We are in the process to also set Open Source this viewing software as well as a Java and C# Library that can read and write RCM-DX directly. The SBB is hoping to attract a community for those tools in order to have a free and open standard format for measuring data in the rail infrastructure domain. In an ideal world, in future a railway company can mention this format in an open tender and thus ensure, that data produced is open and readable. Also a new company, creating a new measurement system can rely on this viewing software and data format and thus lower its initial amount of work to enter the market. We would like to show our current state and let the world see where those components can be obtained</p>",

MOTIS offers a JSON-API via HTTP(S). It reads timetables in GTFS and can update its data model with GTFS-RT. Our current focus is the profile-based computation of fully accessible routes for people with disabilities as well as the implementation of a data model and algorithms that can efficiently work with timetables of arbitrary length.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>For ten years i'm involved in Public transport digital services (especially traveler information, trip planner, Mobility as a Service at Hove and now i'm the SNCF open data platform coordinator). I'm an Open transport advocate working for SNCF Group and organising Open Transport meetups, mainly in France, being also part of initatives who works on commons like Fabrique des mobilitÃ©s or OpenStreetMap. As i was part of the team when we opened Navitia trip planner source code and decided to have an open based strategy step by step (transport open data / open source / open API and SDK), i had the chance to be at the center of this great adventure at Hove, connecting with Navitia reusers an contributors, developing links with Open transport community.\nAs open transport also means open innovation, it's important to work on developer's experience to facilitate either the integration of Navitia (open source) or the development of innovative services with Navitia Playgroung (Navitia API console).\nI propose to have a look in the rear view mirror, either the successes, showing concrete use cases from different sectors (mobility, tourism, real estate, employment), Navitia's reusers and contributers,... or some difficulties (long is the road), what are the next steps in the transport industry, with the European Union.</p>",

      "description": "<p>KDE Itinerary supports you on the road by presenting all relevant travel dates and documents in a timeline, with all its content being automatically extracted from flight, train and bus tickets, hotel reservations or event tickets. Unlike with proprietary alternatives, all of this happens on the user's device and under the user's control. Itinerary can then augment this with realtime information about disruptions and suggest public transport options to get from the station to the hotel for example. For connections in complex train stations Itinerary also provides OSM-based indoor maps including the realtime operational status of elevators where available.</p>\n\n<p>In order to support the travel data extraction from tickets, decoding several standard and proprietary ticket barcode formats has been implemented. Besides UIC 918.3 and ERA SSB/TLB this as of recently also includes the rather complex new European international ticket standard \"Flexible Content Barcode\" (FCB). For a few proprietary barcodes we are still struggling with reverse engineering and/or finding the corresponding documentation though.</p>\n\n<p>For querying public transport journeys and disruption information several open and proprietary backends are supported, such as Navitia, OpenTripPlanner, OpenJourneyPlanner/TRIAS, Hafas and EFA. The focus here is on unified access to common information rather than to support every possible detail and journey customization option. One still missing but particularly difficult to model piece of information however are prices and tariffs.</p>\n\n<p>With over 80 currently supported online services, automating discovering and managing information about those also becomes relevant. We will look at the Transport API Repository project as well as Itinerary's approach of adding line and product metadata from OSM and Wikidata for this.</p>\n\n<p>Realtime data of the operational status of elevators and escalators or the train coach layout at a given platform are also supported, but unfortunately not as widely available. This tends to be particularly relevant information for users with mobility restrictions though.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Accurate description of the railway network as always been a key resource to manage train circulations. To solve common problems of operation simulation requires a great amount of data of high quality:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Comprehensive geometry (length, incline, curve) and topology of tracks, including switches and crossings and of passing points (stations, points of interest); \n\nCirculation restrictions, associated to tracks (speed limit, track vacancy detection, electrification, loading gauge); \n\nRolling stock (power, size, weight, contents). \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>â¯</p>\n\n<p>Historically, this data has been created and maintained by rail infrastructure managers, to construct the timetable, sell train paths to transporters and maintain the infrastructure. The strategic nature of the data has been reassessed these last years, as open data regulation evolved in Europe (public money = public data), compelling infrastructure managers to publish some of their data. Open data supports innovative product emergence inside and outside of the company, and is a requirement on open-source projects, to allow collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, published data is not meeting expectations: poor documentation, no information on data quality, low frequency updates, missing data, heterogeneous coverageâ¦</p>\n\n<p>â¯</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, since 2007 on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, a collaborative geographic database of the world, volunteers have mapped the European railway network with great accuracy, using mainly aerial imagery and field knowledge provided by railway enthusiasts. Because of its overall quality, coverage, and easy access, projects started to use OSM data instead of company-provided open data (OpenRailwayMap, OpenRailRouting).</p>\n\n<p>Using OSM data has many advantages: public and decentralized (anyone can access, at any time), constantly updated with detailed metadata, world coverage, easy updating of incorrect data, data model flexibility allowing new usages, powerful open-source tools to edit and ascertain data quality, protective license (OdBL).</p>\n\n<p>But there are still many challenges to address: integrating company-sourced open data in OSM while respecting the community work (and as so, challenging the ownership of the data as a data producer), establishing public data quality reports, integrating real-time and non-geographic data (such as rolling stocks) that cannot be published on OSM, work with other users to ensure the data model and data quality suits every use, etc.</p>\n\n<p>â¯</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we will compare current railway network data availability and quality on OpenStreetMap and on company-owned open data platforms of several European countries.

Bidirectional charging (V2G) is a tech buzzword, but even all those EV owners whose cars support V2G have to wait for the industry to offer them optimal and automated operation.\nAll of them? No. A small but growing group of Nissan Leaf owners are not waiting, but install a stack of open technologies in their home and live the new energy future.\nThis talk will explain how HomeAssistant, FlexMeasures and NextCloud were put together to take a step into the future. In open source, we should build combined solutions from strong existing tools more often!\nWe'll look at one year of data and discuss what could happen next.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Vehicle-to-grid charging (V2G), also referred to as bidirectional charging, means your car battery is not only drawing power from the grid, but might also discharge (back) into the grid.\nThe consequences for the power system are highly consequential, but also from the user perspective: You can save a lot of money if you use your own solar power or use dynamic tariffs.\nYet, commercial vendors are slow to offer optimized charging to households, let alone V2G. There are reasons for this, but we set out to show that they are not fundamentally technical.\nWhile the industry world is dragging their feet, the power and maturity of open source allowed us to put together an open stack to allow cost-optimized and automated bidirectional charging at home, with a user-friendly UX design built on top, as well. We used strong, existing tools, and added a thin application layer (a HomeAssistant plugin). This design approach should be on the table more often in the open-source community.\nWe will explain the design of this stack, as well as the data we collected and potential monetary benefits for the user.\nAt the moment, the stack is rolled out at the homes of other enthusiastic front-runners. This will make sure the solution becomes more mature and makes steps to scalability. As industry is also dragging their feet on supporting the OCPP protocol, we can only support one charger right now, the Wallbox Qasar, but there is no technical limit to supporting other bidirectional chargers. We are curious if others are interested to support more chargers, and make the stack even easier to install and monitor.\nSoon, the commercial world will roll out more bidirectional chargers and cars (we use the Nissan Leaf), as well as home energy management solutions which lock users into specific vendor relationships (where the car is just one of the managed services). It's crucial to provide an open-source alternative, to provide independence for users, and to inspire startups.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Digital technology is a major contributor to environmental harm, whether it is the 'tsunami' of e-waste filling landfills or the CO2 emissions on a par with the aviation industry.</p>\n\n<p>Oft overlooked is that software plays a crucial role. For instance, software bloat means less powerful hardware may stop working and end up as toxic waste in landfills, while new devices are manufactured unnecessarily -- the production of which often costs more energy than usage over their operating life. Moreover, software bloat also entails that the software will have higher energy demands and pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- in order to achieve the same result. Digital sustainability is, in many ways, a question of software.</p>\n\n<p>The Blue Angel ecolabel, the official environmental label of the German government, began certifying software in 2020. In the award criteria, sustainability is closely linked with transparency and user autonomy. This connection has been one of the motivations behind the KDE Eco initiative since its beginning in 2021. In this talk I will present the environmental harm driven by software, with a focus on energy consumption. I will link the values of Free and Open Source software to sustainable software design. Finally, I will provide an overview of the work of the KDE Eco project and the new sustainability goals of KDE.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>A number of openâsource energy system models are now active in the global south and this presentation provides an update.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Energy system models are simulations of future energy systems that can be used to test scenarios. More specifically, such models can explore a range of netâzero options in an integrated fashion, determine which scenarios are feasible, and then report on system development trajectories, detailed and aggregate costs, and related attributes for further consideration. Many of the underlying modeling frameworks are now fullyâfledged openâsource projects.  In addition, there are several nascent initiatives to develop coherent databanks and also the overarching data standards they require, with both endeavors suitably open licensed.</p>\n\n<p>These various efforts are now starting to spill into the global south generally and subâSaharan Africa in particular. A number of potential benefits then arise from this kind of open analysis.  The first is the zero monetary cost of course.  The next is organic knowledge transfer both northward and southward within the various project communities. A third is doubtless that a greater range of scenarios will be placed on the table â indeed I sense that the multilateral agencies working in Africa have settled on a selected set of solutions and that suggestions that fall outside the prevailing orthodoxy are unwarranted and unwanted. A fourth potential advantage is local engagement, and further, the prospects of improved local autonomy â and while there are no examples of modelâmediated public processes in the global south as yet, that concept is being trialed in the global north.</p>\n\n<p>The use of open analysis in the global south will offer distinctive challenges nonetheless.  The most obvious difficulty is data availability and a number of proxy solutions have been developed.  The next is how best to channel these efforts into public policy formation and then on to live projects.  Also critical will be the necessity of finding new ways of interacting between official agencies and these clearly informal modeling communities.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the leading openâsource framework projects, OSeMOSYS and PyPSA, have begun significant efforts to broaden into the global south.  These two initiative will be reviewed (I am not directly involved in either).</p>\n\n<p>Clearly early days still but sufficient progress has been made to warrant an update at FOSDEM'23.</p>",

In the talk, an overview of the current status on features provided by open-source tools compared to their in-house counterparts, and possible synergies to foster open-source adoption using a community approach. Practical examples by the PyPSA and PyPSA meets Earth initiative for global energy planning will be discussed in detail.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Energy transition is a major challenge that no one can tackle alone. Collaboration across national boundaries and sectors and within civil society is necessary and open data and open-source software are promising tools to identify costs and opportunities and accelerate the uptake of netâzero technologies, especially in developing countries where resources are often scarce. However, except for few notable institutions, in-house software and data dominate industry and policy decision making in energy matter.\nMany large entities have been historically reluctant to use open-source software and open data, for concerns including data quality, technical support on open tools, lack of features, or reliability of results.  Nevertheless, the open community has been developing several tools for various energy applications, which can meet many needs by utilities, policy makers and industry. However, despite the open-source alternative, often closed software is still the standard approach.\nThe presentation will describe the status of open data and open-source tools adoption in the energy sector will be discussed, including a proposal on how to fill the missing steps using community of communities: open-source communities shall help each other towards practical adoption. Focus will be given on the comparison of features provided by selected in-house models and the open-source counterpart, including the examples by PyPSA and PyPSA meets Earth initiatives that actively promote open data and open-source tools for global energy planning. The initiatives have demonstrated that fully open energy modelling, from the data till the solver, is already possible at Continental scale with reasonable accuracy, even in areas where data access is generally more difficult, such as at African level. In conclusion, the major lessons learnt from open energy modelling initiatives will be drawn, highlighting synergies among open-source communities to foster adoption.</p>",

But in the past 6 years, the ecosystem focus has shifted higher in the stack onto cloud-native solutions, which run on top of an existing cloud infrastructure. Does that mean that open source cloud infrastructure solutions, like OpenStack, are no longer relevant?</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, Thierry Carrez, the General Manager for the Open Infrastructure Foundation, the non-profit hosting the OpenStack project, will explore this question. After examining the motivation and history of OpenStack over the past decade, we will explore what makes OpenStack relevant in the next decade, with a special attention to the European context. While it is not for everyone, new use cases like Digital Sovereignty or Edge computing are driving renewed adoption of OpenStack, especially in combination with Kubernetes (what is called the Linux OpenStack Kubernetes Infrastructure, or LOKI).</p>",

      "description": "<p>This talk will present our usage of SPDK, Storage Performance Development Kit,\nwith the Xen hypervisor and discuss memory sharing mechanisms in hypervisors\nfrom a security and performance perspective.</p>\n\n<p>SPDK is a userspace NVMe driver allowing access to these types of storage\ndevices with minimal overhead from the operating system. It allows you to\nmaximize the performance usage of new storage technologies, as well as having faster\ndevelopment times of applications serving IO because of the easier development\ncycle of running in userspace. In our case, we use it as a storage backend\nfor virtual machines where an SPDK application establishes a connection with\nvirtual machines through shared memory.</p>\n\n<p>This sharing of memory, in a virtualized environment, gives access to the\noutside world to a virtual machine. In the case of Xen, the sharing mechanism,\ncalled Grant Table, uses the hypervisor as a trusted intermediary to allow\nsharing memory with another virtual machine. The backend doing device\nmultiplexing only get access to areas explicitely permitted by the frontend.\nThis permits the guest to not completely trust the storage provider software\nwith complete access to private memory, but the extra security of this model\ndoesn't come for free. We would like to discuss improvements that could be\nadded that would still keep the security aims of the Grant Table mechanism\nwhile providing a high performance interface.</p>",

The upcoming Virtio Video driver conforms to the memory-to-memory stateful interface and draws upon a mature ecosystem to speed up media workflows in a guest OS by tapping into the host's hardware. In doing so, it is a step further in the general direction of establishing a de-facto standard for media handling in different hypervisors.</p>\n\n<p>This talk goes over the upcoming VA-API virtio video decoder backend currently in the works for the CrosVM hypervisor. It explains how the flexibility of Virtio technology can be paired with a very established API in order to produce a robust solution in video decoding virtualization, effectively blending the worlds of stateful and stateless interfaces. It details how the community at large stands to benefit from it and how it both validates and helps propel the development of the work-in-progress virtio video protocol itself.</p>\n\n<p>The talk will also cover the latest developments in the work in progress VirtIO Video protocol and delve in the architecture of cros-codecs, which is a project that aims to offer video decoding capabilities to the Rust ecosystem as a whole.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>GNU Guix is our beloved reproducible software deployment toolbox.  It is a package manager also able to create isolated computational environments.  It is even able to produce pack containers.  Or, it can be a complete system.  In addition of focusing on reproducibility, it provides some key features as roll-back, declarative configuration, or time-machine, to name some.  GNU Guix respects the four essential freedoms: run the program as you wish; study how the program works and change it for computing as you wish; share copies for helping others; distribute modified versions for improving.</p>\n\n<p>Open science considers that scientific practices must be more open, transparent, collaborative and inclusive, coupled with more accessible and verifiable scientific knowledge subject to scrutiny and critique.  Such enterprise will improve the quality, reproducibility and impact of science, and thereby the reliability of the evidence needed for robust decision-making and policy and increased trust in science.  Quoting UNESCO.</p>\n\n<p>Wait, Guix and Open science seems so well matched.  This presentation is an attempt to illustrate how the Guix project is helping Open science.  We emphasize two features of Guix that implement Open science principles: transparent and long-term.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Guile has a new garbage collector coming!  The Whippet collector improve throughput and scalability of Guile programs, and is built in such a way that it can be swapped into most any language runtime that uses that BDW-GC.  With minimal adaptations in user code, you get a collector that's competitive with the industry-standard Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative collector, but which scales better for multiple allocation threads.  As incremental changes are made in Guile to integrate Whippet, we will also gain the ability to compact the heap, even while keeping conservative scanning of the C stack.  This talk presents the structure of whippet and some performance numbers for how it improves Guile program behavior.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The Whippet garbage collector provides an abstract interface that user programs (like Guile) can use to allocate memory, and also provides a number of collectors that implement that API.  One of them is the BDW-GC collector: this will be the first step in Guile's switch to Whippet, to change to use the Whippet API but keep the same GC implementation.  Compile-time flags choose the collector implementation, and in the next step, Guile will switch over to Whippet's main collector, an Immix-derived mark-region collector.  This collector has a few modes, including a heap-conservative mode that mimics BDW-GC, as well as a stack-conservative mode that allows evacuation and compaction of objects that aren't referenced by conservative roots.</p>\n\n<p>The talk will include a quick overview of Immix-style collectors, for context.</p>\n\n<p>Whippet scales: it has been carefully designed to avoid contention during allocation, and avoid locking except during collection.  Collection is optionally parallel and optionally generational.  We'll examine the performance and practical impacts of these choices, in synthetic test harnesses and in real Guile programs.</p>\n\n<p>Whippet is designed to be included into a user's C source code, as it needs compile-time configuration.  The talk will show examples of the size of the collector and its memory efficiency when compared to BDW-GC and to a semispace collector.</p>",

      "description": "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a new functional and object-oriented language that aims at unifying\ndifferent concepts to reduce the complexity of the language and tools processing\ncode written in Fuzion.  The biggest difference between functional and\nobject-oriented languages is the handling of side-effects: In an ideal\nfunctional world, all functions are pure, i.e., free from side-effects, while in\nobject-oriented languages like Java it is common to make frequent use of side\neffects, e.g. a Java method to read data would usually be a function <em>read()</em>\nthat would return the read data and have the side-effect of advancing the\ncurrent position in the input to the next element.</p>\n\n<h2>Side Effects</h2>\n\n<p>Side-effects may come in very different forms: I/O operations that interact with\nthe outside world are just one example, other side effects are access or\nmodification of global state, program termination or early abortion of some\noperation (e.g., via throwing an exception), logging, thread interactions,\nyielding data to a co-routines, etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Algebraic Effects</h2>\n\n<p>An algebraic effect is a set of operations that provide a certain functionality\nthat may include side-effects.  The idea is that any function that requires such\nan operations must do this explicitly, static that it depends on the\ncorresponding effect.  Any caller of a function that requires a certain\nalgebraic effect either itself requires that same effect, or it must provide a\nhandler that implements that effect.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, say a function <em>f</em> performs some logging operation, so it\nrequires a <em>logger</em> effect that has an operation <em>log</em> that adds one line of\nlogging data.  Any caller <em>g</em> of <em>f</em> therefore also depends on the <em>logger</em>\neffect, unless <em>g</em> itself would provide an implementation of the <em>logger</em> effect\nto be used by <em>f</em>.  If <em>g</em>, e.g., provides a no-op <em>logger</em> implementation that\ndoes nothing in its <em>log</em> operation, then <em>g</em> could be pure and not depend on an\neffect, all the logging information created by <em>f</em> would be ignored.  If,\nhowever, <em>g</em> would provide a logger that writes the log messages to a file, then\n<em>g</em> would no longer require the <em>logger</em> effect, but instead require some file-I/O\nrelated effect.</p>\n\n<p>Operations of an algebraic effect usually return a result, but they may also\nabort the current calculation and directly return the the place the effect was\ninstalled.  This makes effects somewhat similar to exception handling in some\nlanguages. But effects are more general, an operation of an effect may resume\n(return) an arbitrary number of times.</p>\n\n<h2>Type Parameters</h2>\n\n<p>Type parameters or generic types are common in many languages.  Usually, type\nparameters are treated completely separately from normal 'value' parameters.  In\nFuzion, this distinction has been removed, type parameters are treated like\nvalue arguments only that the their actual value is a type.  This permits adding\nfunctionality to types and performing operations on types such as creating an\nvalue of a given type.</p>\n\n<h1>Fuzion Language Overview</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts\nfound in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into\nthe concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety\nfeatures based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate\nrepresentation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis\ntools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel,\nRust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The\ngoal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in\nthese languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis\ntools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical\napplications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and\nenable detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n\n<p>Many current programming languages are getting more and more overloaded with new\nconcepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues.\nLanguages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous\ninner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are\ncurrently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types,\netc.  The possibility of nesting these different concepts results in\ncomplexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and\nexecute the code.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure\nof a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold\nthe contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over\nthe allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and\nlocal variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision\nwhere to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack\nor in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if\ndynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single\nconcept of a feature, the language implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Side-effects and Security</h1>\n\n<p>Unexpected side-effects in library calls are the cause of a number of recent\nsecurity vulnerabilities such as log4shell.  The talk will give some examples.</p>\n\n<h1>Algebraic Effects in Fuzion</h1>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, algebraic effects are features that inherit from a standard library\nfeature <em>effect</em>.  Algebraic effects are identified by their type, so different\nheirs of <em>effect</em> create different operations.  So the declaration of an effect\n<em>my</em>effect<em> that provides an operation </em>my<em>operation</em> is a feature declaration\nof <em>my</em>effect<em> inheriting form </em>effect<em> and declaring an inner feature\n</em>my<em>operation</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the caller of a feature has to provide an implementation of an effect, it\nis said that an effect has to be present in the environment of a given call. The\nsyntax to access an operation <em>my</em>operation<em> of an effect of type </em>my<em>effect</em>\nuses the keyword <em>env</em> as follows: <em>my</em>effect.env.<em>my</em>operation<em>, meaning that\nwe take the implementation of </em>my<em>effect</em> from the current environment and then\nperform <em>my</em>operation_ on it.</p>\n\n<h2>Algebraic Effect Examples</h2>\n\n<p>The talk will interactively show how effects can be declared, used and\ninstalled.</p>\n\n<h1>Type Parameters in Fuzion</h1>\n\n<p>The talk will present the syntax of type parameters and the declaration of\noperations associated with types.  This enables a functional counterpart static\nmethods in languages like Java without adding global state.</p>\n\n<p>It will be shown how this can be used to implement an abstract equality\noperation that permits the definition of different implementations for different\ntypes along an inheritance hierarchy.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>\n\n<p>The addition of effects and type parameters were important steps to make the\nlanguage more powerful while staying true to the spirit of Fuzion which is to\nsimplify and unify aspects as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>A small team of developers is now working on the Fuzion implementation with a\nfocus on the standard library, performance and interfaces with other languages.</p>\n\n<p>Main points that are missing right now are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a powerful standard library</li>\n<li>additional library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>\n<li>low-level foreign language interface for C</li>\n<li>actual implementations of static analyzers and optimizers</li>\n<li>highly optimizing back-ends</li>\n<li>garbage collection for the C back-end</li>\n<li>documentation, tutorials</li>\n<li>more enthusiastic contributors and users!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Please feel free to contact me in case you want to use Fuzion or want to help\nmaking it a success!</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>An important sign of intelligence is the capacity to apply a body of declarative knowledge to a particular situation in order to, e.g., derive new knowledge, to determine relevant questions or to provide explanations.\nIDP-Z3 is a reasoning engine that displays such intelligence: the knowledge is represented in the declarative language FO(.), aka FO-dot, and, based on that knowledge, IDP-Z3 can perform a variety of reasoning tasks under the control of a host language, Python.  This re-use of knowledge dramatically reduces software development time.\nFO(.) is an expressive, yet very readable language that extends first order logic.\nWe present IDP-Z3, and how we used it to build a generic user interface, called the Interactive Consultant, that helps end-users make the right decision fast, within a particular problem domain.</p>",
      "description": "<p>FO(.) (aka FO-dot) is the Knowledge Representation language used by the IDP-Z3 reasoning engine.</p>\n\n<p>FO(.) was introduced by Prof. Denecker (KU Leuven).\nIt is based on  first-order logic (FOL) for its constructs (i.e., logic connectives and quantification).\nFO(.) extends FOL with a few language constructs to express complex information such as non-inductive, inductive and recursive definitions, and  aggregates.</p>\n\n<p>An FO(.) Knowledge Base consists of a vocabulary and a \"theory\".\nThe vocabulary describes the domain-specific symbols that are used in the theory.\nA theory is a collection of assertions about possible state of affairs.\nThere are three classes of assertions: constraints, definitions and enumerations.\nStates of affairs are represented by structures, that contains the values of the symbols of the vocabulary.\nA structure that is possible according to the theory is called a model.</p>\n\n<p>A Knowledge Base (KB) written in FO(.) cannot be run: it is just a \"bag of information\" formally describing models in a problem domain.\nThis is a consequence of the FO(.) design goal to be task-agnostic.\nA corollary is that such a KB does not distinguish inputs from outputs, and allows reasoning in any direction.</p>\n\n<p>A key advantage of the model-theoretic semantics is that it allows reasoning with incomplete knowledge of the state of affairs.\nThis knowledge is encoded in a partial structure.\nWhen not much is known, many states of affairs are possible, and the theory has many models representing them.\nAs more information is obtained, the set of models is reduced.\nThis reduced set of models can be used to perform various forms of reasoning, e.g., to derive the consequences of what is known, or to find the model that maximizes a utility function.</p>\n\n<p>As a very simple example, consider the voting law that states: \"You have to vote in an election if you are at least 18 years old at election time (otherwise you can not)\".\nThe formula in FO(.) is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>vote() &lt;=&gt; 18 =&lt; age().\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the age is known, the obligation to vote can be inferred;\nif the obligation to vote is known to be true instead, the age is known to be 18 or more, in any model.\nFurthermore, one can also find a lower bound of the age of a person, as soon as their obligation to vote is known.</p>\n\n<p>IDP-Z3 is a reasoning engine that can perform a variety of reasoning tasks on knowledge bases in the FO(.) language.\nThe following generic computations are supported by IDP-Z3:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Model checking: Verifies that a theory is satisfiable given a structure, i.e., that it has at least one model.</li>\n<li>Model expansion: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and computes a model of T that expands S, if one exists.</li>\n<li>Propagation: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and computes all their logical consequences, i.e., all the ground literals that are true in every model expansion of T and S.</li>\n<li>Explanation: Takes a theory T, a partial structure S and a literal L obtained by propagation, and computes an explanation for L in the form of a minimal set of axioms in $T \\cup S \\cup {\\lnot L}$ that is inconsistent.</li>\n<li>Optimisation: Takes a theory T, a partial structure S and a term, and computes the minimal value of the term in the set of all model expansions of T and S.</li>\n<li>Relevance: Takes a theory T and a partial structure S, and determines the atoms that are irrelevant (or ``do-not-care'') in the sense that, if one of their value were changed in any model M of T expanding S, the resulting M' structure would still be a model of T.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>IDP-Z3 can be run at the command line, or integrated in a Python application as a Python package downloadable from pypi (https://pypi.org/project/idp-engine/).\nComputations can also be run online via a webIDE (https://interactive-consultant.idp-z3.be/IDE).\nIt is open source (https://gitlab.com/krr/IDP-Z3) under the LGPL 3 license.</p>\n\n<p>IDP-Z3 comes with a demo web application, called the Interactive Consultant, that helps users make decision in accordance with an FO(.) knowledge base, using the reasoning abilities of IDP-Z3.</p>\n\n<p>It is generic in the sense that it can be reconfigured by simply changing the FO(.) knowledge base.\nThe user interface is automatically generated based on the vocabulary of the knowledge base: this helps reduce the cost of developing applications significantly.\nIt is available online (https://interactive-consultant.idp-z3.be/).</p>\n\n<p>The Interactive Consultant (IC) allows the user to enter data in any order.<br/>\nThe IC enables a safe exploration of the decision search space, without the possibility of making decisions leading to dead ends.\nThis is achieved by continuously computing the consequences of the data theory, using propagation.\nIf the user is unsure why the IC propagated a specific choice, they can ask for an explanation.\nAdditionally, while the user fills in what they know, the interface determines which parameters remain relevant, avoiding unnecessary work for the user.\nAfter having input all values that they deem necessary, the user can ask the IC to show the optimal decision according to what is known, using optimization.</p>",

The next step for PipeWire will be to enhance the video sharing support.\nThis talk will briefly outline the architecture of PipeWire, the current status and the future plans.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Chromium has used V4L2 for cameras for many years and it works reasonablyÂ \nwell. Modern complex cameras are no longer a simple V4L2 device. libcameraÂ \nmust be used instead. For Chromium in a Flatpak or Snap container it wouldÂ \nbe nice to manage camera access at runtime. Or let's have some fun and useÂ \nan arbitrary video stream as a camera.</p>\n\n<p>So the goal was to implement some kind of high-level camera interface. TheÂ \nchoice of technology was easy: xdg-desktop-portal is already used forÂ \nscreen sharing and it has support for cameras as well. And PipeWire, theÂ \nmedia daemon that handles the camera already supports libcamera.Â </p>\n\n<p>I started the implementation more than a year ago and it is still ongoing.Â \nThis presentation gives an overview of the technologies involved, how itÂ \nfits all together and the story of the long and winding road to implementÂ \nthis in Chromium.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The music production ecosystem on Linux is huge, and yet it's unortunately not that well known, possibly because it's seen more as \"just\" software for entertainment purposes rather than something much more serious and valuable than that. JACK and, more recently, Pipewire provide an excellent environment for working with low latency music, and there's a ton of applications that can help at different stages of music production. There's software for composing and/or orchestrating your music, using music sheets, piano rolls or patterns; software for processing your real instruments and software for simulating virtual instruments, including complex syntethizers; DAWs to work on music projects in a more organized way; a plethora of plugins that can be used in different applications to customize the way each track needs to be processed, and mix/master your work; and so on and so forth. And while I mostly like working on \"rock\" and orchestral music (and so the talk will focus a bit more on software that helped me do that), there's so much software out there to help with basically any genre that you may be interested in, from classical music to dub and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also talk a bit of the community aspects of it (for instance introducing the LinuxMusicians forum or the \"Made with Ardour\" topic that allowed me to meet so many other people using FOSS to create and share their music), and share a few notes about how you can indeed share your music with the world (or at least how I did it!).</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Live channels are often carried as transport stream over UDP or RTP multicast. Often such a stream must be handed over to a 3rd party for further processing or distribution, via a dedicated L2 Ethernet link. In practice, to ensure network isolation, this requires copying the multicast stream between two VLANs (with optional processing), an operation performed by expensive and proprietary hardware equipments such as DCMs. This presentation will explore the options using standard PCs and OSS such as DVBlast. For even better isolation, the speaker will also explore software virtualization using Linux/KVM and the SR-IOV feature of some network cards. The use of these technologies with multicast has proven difficult, as this case study will show.</p>",

The data an application indirectly generates when in use (the logs and traces) is no different from the data an application directly works with (input and output). So letâs keep them all together in a scalable cloud storage repository. Once it is there, it is just like any other big data. We need to analyze and apply intelligent monitoring to detect situations of interest. So we need to apply trained ML models to a stream of such data for immediate alerting when the traces indicate an unwanted behavior occurring or brewing.

Thus, event logs such as Apache Kafka can be found in almost every architecture, while databases and similar systems still provide the foundation. Change Data Capture (CDC) has become popular for propagating changes. Nevertheless, integrating all these systems, which often have slightly different semantics, can be a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we highlight what it means for Apache Flink to be a general data processor that acts as a data integration hub. Looking under the hood, we demonstrate Flink's SQL engine as a changelog processor that ships with an ecosystem tailored to processing CDC data and maintaining materialized views. We will discuss the semantics of different data sources and how to perform joins or stream enrichment between them. This talk illustrates how Flink can be used with systems such as Kafka (for upsert logging), Debezium, JDBC, and others.</p>",

It also relies on super-fast data ingestion and that is all possible by leveraging on a powerful event-driven streaming platform.  Two very important Open Source Apache projects have risen to serve such a grand purpose: Apache Pulsar for event streaming and Apache Pinot for real-time analytics.  We take a look at how both of these projects can integrate very well together and achieve the blazingly fast results that we desire and show you a use case that we've built.</p>",
      "description": "<p>When you hear \"decision maker\", it's natural to think, \"C-suite\", or \"executive\". But these days, we're all decision-makers. Restaurant owners, bloggers, big box shoppers, diners - we all have important decisions to make and need instant actionable insights. In order to provide these insights to end-users like us, businesses need access to fast, fresh analytics.</p>\n\n<p>In this session we will learn how to build our own real-time analytics application on top of a streaming data source using Apache Pulsar, Apache Pinot, and Streamlit. Pulsar is a distributed, open source pub-sub messaging and streaming platform for real-time workloads, Pinot is an OLAP database designed for ultra low latency analytics, and Streamlit is a Python based tool that makes it super easy to build data based apps.</p>\n\n<p>After introducing each of these tools, weâll stream data into Pulsar using its Python client, ingest that data into a Pinot real-time table, and write some basic queries using Pinotâs Python SDK. Once we've done that, weâll bring everything together with an auto refreshing Streamlit dashboard so that we can see changes to the data as they happen. There will be lots of graphs and other visualisations!</p>\n\n<p>This session is aimed at application developers and data engineers who want to quickly make sense of streaming data.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Opening up European Public Procurement Data",
      "abstract": "<p>TEDective is a free software (open-source) solution that makes European public procurement data explorable for non-experts. Letâs say you are a curious citizen who wants to find out how much taxpayer money your municipality spends each year on unfree software. To date, there is no free software-backed, community-developed application out there that helps you answer this question.</p>\n\n<p>TEDective changes that by bringing light into the public procurement data published by the EUâs Tenders European Daily (TED) project. It transforms the XML files provided by TED into the interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) and then visualizes the data as a graph of relationships between companies and the public bodies they supply. Currently, neo4j is used to store the TEDective graph. Finally, the data will be enriched by other complementary data sources such as OpenCorporates and OpenSanctions.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Every year, public institutions in the EU spend more than â¬2 trillion on various goods and services. While the EU publishes a lot of data about public procurement in the form of TED (https://ted.europa.eu), somebody interested in European public procurement still faces a lot of difficulties: TED data is overly complex, doesnât follow the international and interoperable Open Contracting Data Standard and is hard to explore as the UI provided by TED is limited to basic filtering and search.</p>\n\n<p>This situation was the starting point for TEDective â an initiative by the Free Software Foundation Europe to make European public procurement data both accessible and explorable - for everybody. We believe that the transparency needed by such a solution to function in the interest of its users can only be provided by a community-led free software project. TEDective is such a project. The project already won the first prize at this yearâs EU Datathon. With this initial funding, we are now keen to spread the word and build a community of data science, procurement and usability experts who can help us in our quest to open up and democratise European public procurement data.</p>\n\n<p>In the talk, we will show you what we have done so far and how you can help us make TEDective more useful every day.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for exploratory data analysis as it is very easy to process and visualize data using traditional charts. However, they lack utilities to properly explore networks interactively. The ipysigma library therefore proposes a Jupyter widget enabling its users to perform visual network analysis from the comfort of a notebook. ipysigma makes it simple to tweak a network's visual variables to display it exactly as you intend. This way, you can perform a work at the crossroad between Python processing of graph data and visual exploration like you would do for example with Gephi. It supports networkx and igraph seamlessly and can be easily used by numpy and pandas users all the same. Different usecases of ipysigma will be showcased during the talk through a dataset about FOSDEM history. We will also demonstrate how ipysigma is able to render synchronized &amp; interactive \"small multiples\" of a same network so that one can easily compare different features. ipysigma is developed at the mÃ©dialab of SciencesPo and uses graphology and sigma.js (JavaScript libraries able to render interactive graphs in web browsers).</p>\n\n<p>N.B.: Talk was actually given by Benjamin Ooghe-Tabanou, replacing a very ill Guillaume Plique.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Graphs today are not only very large and heterogeneous, but also change over time. In addition to the typical storage of a graph in a database and subsequent analysis, some use cases require reactivity, and thus recent work has focused on processing the graph in a stream model. Real-time query and analysis of high-frequency incoming graph data, such as social network interactions, click streams, bike rentals, or supply chain product updates, provides continuous insights into to the most recent portion of the graph.</p>\n\n<p>Graph summarization (or grouping) as a typical analysis has been well explored for static graphs, but there are just a few new approaches using of a graph stream, especially when the stream is modelled after the property graph model and thus has labels and properties on the streamed vertices and edges. In this talk, we present a graph stream grouping algorithm and a distributed reference implementation based on Apache Flink. It enables window-based summarization of the property graph stream by grouping vertices and edges on equal characteristics using so-called key functions. This enables various zoom granularities, from a schema graph stream to more fine-grained summarizations. In addition, elements leading to a group can be aggregated in flexible ways to provide deeper insights in the respective summarized vertices and edges. A bicycle rental graph stream is used to demonstrate the power of the algorithm and the multitude of analytical questions that can be answered with it.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Search GitLab, Redmine, and repositories with a single query",
      "abstract": "<p>This talk will illustrate how organizations can configure and deploy OSS enterprise search server Fess, based on our own experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Fess is, by and large, a well-documented, user-friendly tool. Yet, no matter how good the tool is, deploying a search server on your own brings a number of challenges. I will talk about the challenges we had and how we overcame them. Our hope is that</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You will have a good grasp of what it is like to configure and deploy an enterprise search server, whether or not you are considering deploying one at the moment.</li>\n<li>Should you decide to deploy one, you can (hopefully) do so with a significantly lower cost.</li>\n</ol>",
      "description": "<p>Today's technology companies often use multiple content management systems, resulting in information (e.g. source code, document files, and wiki pages) fragmented and stored in many places. Consequently, engineers sometimes end up searching multiple locations one by one, repeating the same query at each place, to look for the information they need.</p>\n\n<p>A solution would be to build and deploy a search server which, given a query, fetches the relevant code and documents from all the content management systems, much like a web search, such as Google, does on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>This would be a daunting task, as it would essentially mean setting up and maintaining the whole end-to-end system of search as a service, from web crawlers to search box UI. Fortunately, there is an OSS search server built for this exact purpose. We are here to share the knowledge, experiences, and insights we have gained so far, so that you can build your own enterprise search server, using OSS.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I will first explain what search-related problems we had to solve, as well as briefly touching on what enterprise search is in general.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I'll go over what Fess is and explain its core features, which will serve as an introductory, informational session for this lesser-known OSS enterprise search server.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on to the core part of the talk, I will dive deep into how we configured, customized, and deployed Fess for our specific purpose. Our objectives were</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>to index contents on issue tracking/project management tools we use (GitLab &amp; Redmine) and in repositories (Git &amp; Subversion)</li>\n<li>to enable users to search the indexed contents from a single search box.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>We achieved both of these objectives but we had to overcome several hurdles. I will share things such as what pitfalls/shortcomings Fess has and how to overcome them.</p>\n\n<p>I will also talk about what we have made and contributed; our dev team wrote several patches for fixing and customizing Fess. 3 of the patches are bug fixes and 2 of them have been merged into the mainline. 2 other patches are customizations designed to meet our specific requirements. One of them allows the crawler to pass the custom authentication page of our GitLab implemented with SAML and Keycloak. The other patch re-maps the crawled filesystem paths to the webpage URLs; this was crucial to cut the time to index contents in repositories by reading files on the local filesystem instead of following links on the webpages.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this segment is to provide the information which will allow future Fess users to deploy it with a dramatically smaller time and effort investment.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I will share our experiences with our preliminary deployments inside TOSHIBA. We will explain resource requirements and performance, such as how long it takes to crawl and index a given size of resources (basically web pages and files) using how much computing resource. This will help future Fess users make estimates on how much computing resource they need to secure in order to deploy it. Along with that, we will reveal details such as how Fess's ability to index contents inside Microsoft Office documents and PDF files helped engineers.</p>",

      "description": "<p>A quick overview: bulk upload, profile page, appointment booking, Nextcloud Office and Nextcloud Backup in Nextcloud 24, which we named Hub II. 3 months later, Hub II/25 introduced User migration, smart file locking, 4x lower db load, Reactions &amp; media tab in Talk, Reply to calls &amp; messages in Desktop client, Undo send &amp; schedule emails. Then, Hub 3 brought a complete design overhaul with much accessibility work, Photos 2.0 with image editor &amp; face recognition, message expiration, polls and direct document creation in Talk, an org chart in Contacts, a lot of performance work and more. Don't think you can now skip the talk - there's a ton more!</p>",

In November 2022, the French Government officially asked schools to not use Google's and Microsoft's collaboration services. Luckily there are open source alternatives that can be self-hosted to give individuals and institutions more contol over their data. While users thus do no more need to rely on big companies, they still need to trust the system administrators hosting the software to respect the user's privacy.</p>\n\n<p>CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted open source collaboration suite. It seeks to reconcile collaboration and privacy. Users make changes to documents and these are encrypted by their client (web browser) before being sent to the server for real-time synchronization. CryptPad hides the technicalities of encryption from its users and provides a clean and intuitive interface to ease fast adaption.\nIn this talk I will present how CryptPad keeps the user's data private and protects them against a passively sniffing server. I will show why we combine end-to-end encryption with open source and will talk about the ecosystem around CryptPad.</p>",

Looking at these categories, we can define shared and specific communication needs for working and collaborating together.</p>\n\n<p>Zulip has made key design choices and invested in developing many features to address these particular needs. Let's dive in and explore together the unique characteristics of Zulip and how they can (and have) impacted collaboration and communication in FOSS and research communities.</p>",

One part of it is enabling a user stored in a LDAP server to locally authenticate in a system using a FIDO2 key. Another part is to use FIDO2 authentication to obtain a Kerberos ticket. This opens a new world to organizations to tighten their security, while maintaining strict control as to who access their systems.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will focus on the progress in FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication in SSSD by providing the implementation state, the solution details and a demo.

That one doesnât risk running malicious software when updating software their system?  For free system distributions, The Update Framework (TUF) has become a reference on these matters.  However, TUF is designed with binary distributions in mindâthink Debian or even PyPIâand is not suite for âsource distributionsâ like GNUÂ Guix.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk I will present how Guix distributes software packages and the mechanisms central to supply chain security in Guix: reproducible builds, builds from source (the âfull-source bootstrapâ), and provenance tracking.  Software updates in Guix amount to âgit pullâ so the security of updates translates to the ability to authenticate Git checkouts.</p>\n\n<p>Believe it or not, this pretty fundamental problem was still in search of a solution.  Guix developed a simple mechanism for Git authentication, which has been used in production for a couple of years. I will present it and, given that the solution is generic, show how it could benefit Git users alike.

Many companies, including \"big tech\", claim that their platforms enable users to privately collaborate. However, the definition of what privacy actually means varies widely. While there are no ways to verify claims made about proprietary software, the impact on users is very tangible.</p>\n\n<p>CryptPad is an end-to-end encrypted open source collaboration suite. It seeks to reconcile collaboration and privacy. Users make changes to documents and these are encrypted by their client (web browser) before being sent to the server for real-time synchronization. In this talk I will detail CryptPad's privacy definition and introduce the assumed threat model of an honest-but-curious server. While users have to trust the server to not actively attack their privacy, they can nevertheless protect themselves against a passively sniffing server. I will show why end-to-end encryption is not enough, but must be combined with open source to achieve reasonable privacy in this model.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/\">CrowdSec</a> project aims at providing a crowdsourced approach to common infrastructure defense problems by distributing free &amp; open-source software allowing you to protect yourself and share information about malevolent actors.</p>\n\n<p>In this Presentation, we will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Learn about CrowdSec project</li>\n<li>Learn how to install CrowdSec in Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Learn how you can detect and block attacks in your applications deployed in k8s</li>\n</ul>",
      "description": "<p>CrowdSec could be perceived as a modern form of Fail2ban, though for Cloud and container-based infrastructure as well, and capable of taking way more advanced decisions a lot faster. Mainly, itâs using a decoupled and distributed approach (detect here, remedy there) and an inference engine that leverages leaky buckets, YAML &amp; Grok patterns to identify aggressive behaviors. It acquires signals from various data sources like files, syslogd, journald, AWS Cloudwatch and Kinesis, Docker logs, and Windows Event Log, normalizes them, enriches them to apply heuristics and triggers a bouncer to deal with the threat if need be. Since itâs written in Go, itâs compatible with almost any environment, fast in execution, and resource-conservative.</p>\n\n<p>The endgame is the Reputation engine, though. If you want to partake in the network to benefit from its findings, CrowdSec captures all aggression signals (timestamp, IP, behavior) and sends them for curation. That way, it establishes a reliable IP blacklist that is constantly redistributed to the network members to achieve a form of Digital Herd Immunity. An IP caught aggressing WordPress sites will quickly be banned by all members using CrowdSec that subscribed to the WordPress defense collection. In that way, we share the IPs that are relevant to your technical context.</p>\n\n<p>While Crowdsec is in charge of the detection, the reaction is performed by \"bouncers\" that aim to be deployable at any level of the applicative / infrastructure stack :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>via nftables/iptables/pf based on an IP set</li>\n<li>via Nginx lua plugin</li>\n<li>via Traefik middleware</li>\n<li>on Cloudflare via our bouncer that integrates with Cloudflare API</li>\n<li>Or GCP/AWS/Azure firewall, slack or scripting, notifications, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>.. or in many other ways. Over time the possibilities will increase as the application design basically supports anything.</p>\n\n<p>This approach, combined with a declarative configuration and a stateless behavior, will make it an ideal candidate to enhance the security of modern stacks (containers, Kubernetes, serverless, and more generally automatically deployed infrastructures).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we intend to create and share the most accurate database of malevolent actors possible in the form of a real-time IP reputation system accessible through API. Whenever an attack is locally blocked/detected by Crowdsec, the \"meta\" information of the attack is shared amongst participants (source IP, date, and triggered scenario) for redistribution to network members.</p>\n\n<p>We are committed to building a strong community with all that it implies :\n* <a href=\"https://hub.crowdsec.net\">a public hub</a> to find, share and amend parsers, scenarios, and blockers\n* permissive open-source license to stay business-friendly\n* and overall a strong commitment to transparency and community-first mentality by tooling and behavior</p>\n\n<p>The microservice architecture is the most significant security challenge in a Kubernetes cluster. Every application you deploy opens a new potential entry for attackers, increasing the attack surface.\nIn this talk, we'll present the Crowdsec project and see how we can protect a Kubernetes cluster using Crowdsec and the power of the Crowd.</p>",

Although such a quantum computer has not yet been officially announced, some governments recommends protecting data against this type of attack by 2030. The encrypted data shared today could be stored and decrypted soon thanks to this breakthrough innovation.</p>\n\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched in 2017 an international competition to standardise \"post quantum algorithms\". Such algorithms are expected to be resilient to an attack made by a generalist post quantum computer. They are meant to replace in the long term the algorithms that are used today in many secure protocols relying on cryptographic key exchange mechanisms.  The Linphone application is most likely the first open source communication software in the world to have implemented the NIST finalist algorithm in the encryption key category, CRYSTALS-Kyber, as of today. One of the key steps: the development of a modified version of the standardized ZRTP encryption protocol.</p>\n\n<p>A few challenges we have taken:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reach the same level of effectiveness even if cryptographic keys are much larger</p></li>\n<li><p>Remain resilient to classic attacks</p></li>\n<li><p>Be interoperable with encryption features offered by previous versions</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The different steps that have been carried out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Integration of KEM in ZRTP protocol: creation of a modified version of ZRTP that accepts a key exchange algorithm of the type of Key Encapsulation Mechanism</p></li>\n<li><p>Hybridation : conception of an encryption engine combining a classic (EC)DH and a post quantum encryption. Modification of the ZRTP protocol so that it can negotiate two different key exchange algorithms at the same time and securely combine results.</p></li>\n<li><p>Fragmentation: addition of a mechanism to fragment ZRTP packets</p></li>\n<li><p>Integration in Linphone of this new ZRTP library with post quantum capacities and of configuration settings to activate/deactivate the post quantum mode</p></li>\n<li><p>Building of performance tests</p></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Hardware-backed attestation in TLS",
      "abstract": "<p>Authentication among distributed workloads is a critical yet complex task. PKI-based authentication relies heavily on software to anchor the trustworthiness of workloads, therefore failing to reliably convey the security state of the workload in the face of impersonation and persistent attackers. This is most apparent in cases where the underlying platform is particularly exposed and out of the control of the owner, such as in cloud computing and IoT. Hardware features have thus been introduced to enable remotely verifiable âtrust metricsâ using attestation. Such hardware-backed features provide a cryptographic proof of the software stack, and strong guarantees that the cryptographic keys used by the workload are properly protected from exfiltration. However, remote attestation comes with its own need to share and verify metadata, which must be engineered into existing software. While the protocol used to exchange this metadata is largely irrelevant to the actual attestation procedure, its positioning in the networking stack can enable specific use-cases and enhance the performance of the entire system. An appealing approach is to allow the creation of secure channels (such as TLS connections) using attestation metadata as the authentication mechanism. Current designs either rely on running an attestation protocol on top of an existing secure channel, or modify the semantics of certificates to convey attestation information when establishing the secure channel.</p>\n\n<p>Our work focuses on standardising attestation metadata as first-class credentials in TLS. This new approach allows native, opaque metadata to be conveyed for authentication during the TLS handshake instead of (or together with) x509 certificates. Supporting flexibility in deployments without compromising on security has been a prime goal. Thus, we aim to cater to interaction models in which either the client, the server, or both can attest themselves, leveraging any hardware backend, and using different verification topologies. To showcase the standardisation effort, we are also developing an open-source, end-to-end proof-of-concept implementation of one of the interaction models supported. The PoC builds on top of two Linux Foundation projects â Parsec to abstract the root of trust attestation primitives, and Veraison to consume and verify the new evidence formats â and modifies mbedTLS to support a subset of the newly defined TLS extensions. As a hardware root of trust, the proof of concept is currently using a TPM2.0, with support for others being considered.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Europeâs new rulebook to ensure safe, ethical and transparent online spaces, the Digital Services Act (DSA), entered into force on November 16th. In a few months, this regulation will apply to a range of digital services operating in the EU, from intermediary and hosting services to social media platforms and search engines. The DSA will require big changes from the biggest players in social media and search (those with over 45 million âactive monthly usersâ in the EU); content moderation capacities, data access transparency tools and annual audits will now be mandated and governed. This groundbreaking text is the first of its kind, and has already inspired both legislation and voluntary corporate practices around the world.</p>\n\n<p>This lighting talk will speed through the major implications of the DSA and the changes big tech is likely to roll out in response.</p>",
      "description": "<p>On October 27, the Digital Services Act was published in the Official Journal of the EU, culminating years of legislative and advocacy effort. The regulation will impose a sweeping new regime imposing transparency and accountability requirements on digital services operating in the EU. The DSA is asymmetric in structure, with the largest obligations falling to the largest platforms and search engines - those with a systemic role in society.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, these big players will need to\n- improve content moderation capacity and reporting mechanisms\n- provide access to data for vetted researchers\n- assess and mitigate their systemic risks\n- have annual third party audits\n- abide by relevant codes of conduct\n- ban targeted advertising on online platforms by profiling children or based on special categories of personal data such as ethnicity, political views or sexual orientation\n- provide a recommender system not based on user profiling (under the GDPR definition)\n- refrain from âdark patterns' on their interfaces</p>\n\n<p>Against the backdrop of Elon Muskâs acquisition of Twitter and Metaâs gutting of its transparency tool Crowdtangle, the DSA is the EUâs promise to reset a big tech ecosystem.</p>",

Finally, the complexity of Kubernetes makes it very easy to overload a drawing with details. We will look at how Kubernetes clusters are usually drawn by various authors.

      "abstract": "<p>It's been almost 10 years since the demonstration of the earliest Docker client at PyCon in 2013. While container capabilities and tooling existed prior to Docker, we can all agree that the last 10 years has seen an explosion of tools, integrations, and production services all built on container runtime technologies similar to that early Docker engine project.</p>\n\n<p>Given that context, it's a good time to look around and survey the landscape of container developer tooling in use today. While Docker engine, and the companion Docker Desktop product are widely used, the creation of the OCI standards and the launching of the CNCF has allowed for a wide array of tools and projects that also provide developers tools and capabilities to create, build, and run containers and interoperate with container registries. In this talk we'll tour the current world of open source developer tools, including podman, the early simple containerd clients, nerdctl, and the advent of non-Linux platform support built alongside these tools, such as Rancher Desktop, Lima/colima, Finch, and Podman Desktop.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Attendees will learn a bit about each of the container developer tool platforms, what open source components they are built from, and how to see them in context with the other alternatives in this space. We'll demonstrate the similarities and differences, and show how thanks to the OCI specs, interoperability between these tools is guaranteed and that developers have significant choice when deciding what tools to use for local container development.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Operating Kubernetes clusters has never been easy. Managing the cluster lifecycle includes multiple aspects, starting from provisioning the underlying infrastructure to upgrading it. There is a possibility that the fleet of clusters will grow and potentially spread across multiple environments. How to keep all clusters under control? What if we use Kubernetes API for simplifying these tasks? Kubernetes is able to manage our container workloads, but it turns out it can also be extended to manage the lifecycle of multiple clusters. In this presentation, we will go over the fundamentals of cluster lifecycle management and how the Cluster API can help. We will do a deep dive into Cluster API building blocks and see a live demo of provisioning and upgrading clusters on various infrastructure providers.Â </p>",

Back in 2016, we released a complete overhaul of how cgroups work internally: cgroup v2, released with Linux 4.5. This brought many new and exciting possibilities to increase system stability and throughput, but with those possibilities have also come challenges of a type which we have largely not faced in Linux before.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will go into some of the challenges faced in overhauling Linux's resource isolation and control capabilities, and how we've gone about fixing them. This will include some of the most complex and counter-intuitive practical effects we've seen in production, with details of how our expectations and knowledge have developed over the last 5 years using this on over a million machines in production, with insights that are immediately applicable to anyone who runs Linux at scale.</p>",

This greatly reduces the memory overhead of the Kubernetes control plane. It also works towards a serverless k8s control plane where controllers scale to zero when not needed.</p>",
      "description": "<p>WebAssembly (wasm) is a binary format to run applications in lightweight virtual machines. Many compilers support wasm as a target next to arm and x86_64. The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a standardized API for wasm apps to talk to the outside world. Theyâre the âSystem Callsâ of the WebAssembly world.</p>\n\n<p>Combining these two gives you a very lightweight but very secure way to isolate applications. Each wasm app runs in their own sandbox and the runtime decides what external resources it can access. Moreover, wasm apps start up lightning fast!</p>\n\n<p>This proof of concepts builds on the initial work of Markus ThÃ¶mmes and Francesco Guardiani, who introduced the idea of running Kubernetes controllers in WebAssembly. We ported this work to wasmtime and added the ability to unload controllers when they're not being used. Our results show controllers running in wasm use up to 68% less memory compared to containerd. Moreover, by unloading the controllers when they're not needed, the controllers use an additional 50% less memory.</p>",

As a result, I have created an open source simulation framework, Relativitization, to ease the model development.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation, I will introduce the architecture of the framework and how the framework can be used. Besides that, I will introduce a complex social model, a.k.a., a turn-based strategy game, developed based on the framework. I believe the game is useful for educating relativistic physics to the public. As a Ph.D. student in social science with a background in physics, developing an open source software is a challenging process. I will also share my experience in overcoming the challenges.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Why do we need more dedicated, flexible and documented Python libraries for social sciences.",
      "abstract": "<p>This talk is an interim report on a journey to enhance scientific programming in Python within the French social sciences. Scientific programming is a stepstone to develop open and reproductible data projects. In numerous field, tools and libraries were developed thanks to Python to become standards. Backed by detailed documentations, those tools diffuse beyond specialties and frontiers and opens new prospects. Nevertheless, social sciences in France seem to stand appart. One reason may be the precedence of R as a programming langage, with highly specialized libraries lacking sometime of documentation or update. Another one may be the diversity of traditions, data and approaches that can hinder shared practices and ease of use of existing libraries. Based on the experience of a small Python library - PySHS - and the organization of training sessions, I will argue that there is a need (and space) for an high-level and easy to use scientific programming framework in Python dedicate to social sciences that can bridge current practices with the state of the art libraries. Such library could in return help to clarify methodologies. This opens two main question that should be addressed : first, how to maintain the flexibility of scientific programming against overtly specialized tools ; second : how to build a meta-framework with other programming langages as R to avoid fragmentation.</p>",

However, we believe that its use can be much wider and that it can be easily adapted for other studies.</p>\n\n<p>The main features of PIMMI are therefore:\n- ability to process large image corpora, up to several millions files\n- robustness to some modifications of the images (crop, zoom, composition, addition of text, ...)\n- adaptability to different use cases (mainly the nature and volume of the image corpus)</p>\n\n<p>A study using PIMMI will generally be broken down into several steps:\n1. constitution of a corpus of images (jpg and/or png files) and their metadata\n2. choice of PIMMI parameters according to the criteria of the corpus\n3. indexing the images with PIMMI and obtaining clusters of reused images\n4. exploitation of the clusters by combining them with the descriptive metadata of the images</p>\n\n<p>The development of this software is still in progress and we warmly welcome beta-testers, feedback, proposals for new features and even pull requests!</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>CorTexT Platform is the digital platform of the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Science, Innovation and Society (LISIS) held in Paris. This platform aims at empowering open research and studies in social sciences about the dynamic of science, technology, innovation and knowledge production. It covers a large variety of methodological research fields, such as scientometrics, Social Networks Analysis, Natural Language Processing and spatial analysis. Its web application gathers most of the original methods produced by the platform team members (https://www.cortext.net/members/).\nTwelve years after its creation, CorTexT Manager is facing a growth of its usages: in number of users, type of institutions, and locations of the users. Back in 2021, more than 1300 active users came to analyze data on it, producing more than 66 000 calculations, from a wide variety of organizations (laboratories, government agencies, firms, newspapers...) located in 60 countries across the world. In 2019, our users were coming from 39 different countries. In the meantime, scientific production published using one or more sets of methods accessible through CorTexT Manager has nearly doubled: a total of 67 scientific documents citing or mentioning CorText Manager has been identified for 2021 (https://www.cortext.net/publications/).\nAddressing these changes has required significant transformations of CorTexT Manager: both for its technical infrastructure as well as for how its codebase is produced and its academic visibility. This presentation will give a brief overview of what is CorTexT Manager and focus on: the importance of user documentation for scientific reproducibility, questions related to the ownership and copyright of the source code when engineers and developers are supported by multiple research organizations, and how to ensure its academic visibility.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The twitter-explorer is an open-source research tool that allows users without programming skills to collect, transform and visualize Twitter data through the paradigm of networks. It represents different types of platform-specific interaction patterns (retweet, mention, quote, reply) as interactively explorable networks, 2D-spatialized through a force-directed layout algorithm. The tool, and more specifically its interactive aspect, which allows users to read tweets of users from within the network visualization, was built out of a necessity to go back to the actual data in order to understand why certain nodes find themselves in the position they are in. We call this process \"guided close-reading\": the structural overview given by the spatialized network allows the social scientist to find, sort and then analyze relevant content through traditional methods from discourse analysis in order to generate hypotheses about the underlying debate on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation, I would mainly like to discuss the intricacies of tool-building for the social sciences, more specifically the use and interpretability of force-directed layout algorithms, as well as get feedback on the architecture of the tool itself, which is written in Python and JavaScript.</p>",

      "title": "Webmapping and massive statistical data, a democratization story",
      "abstract": "<p>The story of this talk starts eight years ago, with the creation of a mapping-interface [1] to explore one of the fined grained statistical dataset on the french population (number of inhabitants / kmÂ²,  the average income per consumption unit, the percentage of low-income households, ...). These data were derived from localized tax revenues of households and were available in a very fine way i.e on pixels of only 200m x 200m, they were delivered at this time by the French National Institute of Statstics (INSEE) throught a massive spatial data file, which limited their use to a very limited number of people able to handle it. The proposed interface changed this and allowed almost any-body to visualize easily these data in their browser. In this presentation we will mainly discuss how to make such massive spatial data easily accessible to the public. The proposed solution is based on multi-scale aggregation: at high scales, the data are aggregated and at fine scales the final resolution of 200m by 200m is recovered. This interface, which heavily rely on zoom in/zoom out interactions allows users to deal and play with one of the well known problem in geography and spatial statistics namely the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [2] (ie. Data tabulated for different spatial scale levels or according to different zonal systems for the same region will not provide consistent analysis results). This tool has leads to several interactions with new users (journalist, researchers, simple citizen,...) that seem to demonstrate its interest. Since this first project, several other massive datasets (one concerning an updated of the same data-set and one concerning a dataset on all french building) were made available with almost the same system [3,4]. From a technical perspective, this talk will covers the different evolution and open-sources projects that has made this project possible (d3 / postgres / postgis / mapLibre,Leaflet, ...), discussing vector tiles formats, map viewer evolution and a little bit of spatial databases and the development of a little python tool to help other build the same type of visualization.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Scientific articles built on executable notebooks are already common in the domain of scientific publication, where they are an effective tool that brings transparency and openness in research communication (FAIR). However, theyâre not yet widely praised in the humanities.\nLuckily, in the digital humanities, Jupyter notebooks play an important role in data analysis and exploration. They provide a free, powerful and open source platform for analyzing text corpora and other datasets in many programming languages - Julia, Python and R; they flawlessly integrate the browsers and many JavaScript data visualization libraries.\nIn general, digital humanists know very well how to make use of Jupyter notebooks to quickly create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.\nThatâs why we naturally decided to work on Jupyter notebooks when we started playing with the idea of funding a Journal for digital historians in conjunction with the publisher DeGruyter. Developed by the CÂ²DH (Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History and DeGruyter, the Journal of Digital History (https://journalofdigitalhistory.org) now publishes peer-reviewed, open access articles that are Jupyter notebooks in their essence.\nWith a difference: we wanted authors to reflect on their use of algorithms and digital methods, so we asked them to write their articles as compositions of three layers: narrative, data and hermeneutics.\nIn our presentation we will explore the ecosystem of tools and methods we have prepared together with the authors: GitHub, Docker, MyBinder, Zotero. We will present the process we follow with them from scratch notebooks to published multi-layered, reproducible scientific articles.</p>",

I'm trying to change that, and have some successes I'd like to talk about, but there is more work are more challenges in front of us.</p>",
      "description": "<p>There are three major platforms available today: PinePhone, Librem 5 and PinePhone Pro. PinePhone includes \"smart\" camera sensor, which is able to do auto-exposure, auto-focus and JPEG compression on its own. Capturing good photos is relatively simple using Megapixels. Capturing 2MP, 30fps video is possible with some \"interesting\" solutions I'll describe. Librem 5 is much more interesting. It includes dumb 13MP sensor, with support for phase-detection auto focus. Auto-exposure and auto-focus needs to be done in software, with auto-focus being quite complex and requiring different solutions based on use case. I do have unoptimized solutions for auto-exposure and auto-focus in Millipixels project, but they really belong to libcamera. It is possible to capture 0.8MP, 20fps movie. There's really more work to be done on all sides, including kernel -- bayer10 support, caching, libcamera and applications.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this talk was originially scheduled to be given at 13:10.

      "description": "<p>Sailfish OS is an embedded Linux distribution developed by Jolla thatâs designed to run primarily on phone and tablet hardware. The Sailfish community has a proud hardware adaptation track record, having ported Sailfish OS to devices as wide ranging as watches, feature phones, smartphones, tablets and PC hardware. Despite the breadth of successful ports, the process of adapting Linux to a new phone platform can be daunting for new porters. On the other hand, the Sony Open Devices Program makes the process of opening up a selection of Sonyâs Xperia mobile phones for use by porters as easy as possible.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation Iâll look at the process of porting Sailfish OS to Sony Open Device Program devices, see how the Open Devices Program helps in practice, and also look at some of the tools, documentation and infrastructure made available by Jolla to help with this process.</p>\n\n<p>Iâll talk about my own journey as a porter, how I came to start porting and the work Iâm doing now porting Sailfish OS to different Sony Xperia devices. Iâll also talk about how Sailfish porters are able to work with the Sony Open Devices Program for mutual benefit, pushing changes upstream that then flow back down to make porting Sailfish OS or other Linux variants to other Xperia phones in the Open Devices Program more streamlined and reliable.</p>\n\n<p>I will aim to provide enough technical detail so that developers who havenât yet tried porting can go away and get started, but will also aim to include material that is of general interest to more casual mobile phone and Linux users.</p>\n\n<p>If youâve ever wondered what the process of porting Linux to a new hardware platform involves, might even be interested in trying it yourself, then this talk will offer some essential groundwork and highlight one of the easiest routes to getting started.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The PinePhone appeals to those of us who seek autonomy from dominant platform corporations. The talk introduces a new operating system for the PinePhone that is not based on Linux but on Genode. With such an unorthodox underpinning, we found ourself inspired to reimagine the dual notion of the phone as a highly dependable and secure appliance, and as a host for general-purpose applications. The talk will give an overview of Genode, present technical tidbits, and of course demonstrate the OS.</p>",
      "description": "<p>It is hard to imagine our society without smartphones. With the convenience of those handy companions, however, comes the dependence from platform providers who curate, manage, and update the devices for us. This central role has become an incredible leverage for the platform vendors, like Google and Apple. Those of us who want to escape the reach of those powerful corporations find the prospect of openness and transparency of the PinePhone hard to resist.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the PinePhone is primarily meant for the use with Linux, it deserves more than one operating system kernel! Driven by the vision of a truly trustworthy smartphone, we have built a custom operating system for the PinePhone. Its uncompromising architecture is a radical departure from existing Linux-based systems. It combines microkernel technology, capability-based security, sandboxed device drivers, and custom system-control-processor firmware with a new user interface that diverges from the beaten track in interesting ways.</p>\n\n<p>The talk by Genode developer Norman Feske will present the outcome of the past two years of intensive development, touching topics ranging from energy management, over voice telephony and mobile-data connectivity, up to applications like the Morph web browser. It goes without saying that the talk wouldn't be complete without showing the new OS in action.</p>",

This method has mainly been designed for IPv6 networks.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Hash Based IPv6 address:\nThe configuration of an IPv6 network is a rather daunting and error-prone procedure for system administrators. Each node must be provided with its own (128 bit long) IPv6 address and with a domain name manageable by human beings.\nAutoconfiguration methods can give addresses to interfaces but do not provide any means of configuring the DNS. So autoconfiguration is suitable for clients. If a host has to act as a server, it must have a fully qualified domain name and the DNS service has to map its name to its IP address.\nIn the Internet of Thread scenario, the number of network nodes can be orders of magnitude higher than before, as each process or thread can be a node. This idea of hash based IPv6 addresses is a viable solution to the problem to manage the DNS resolution in IoTh environments.</p>\n\n<p>One Time IP:\nHosting servers use a finite number of IP addresses to connect on the net. Attackers can collect those by wiretapping the network and create a catalog of valid addresses and services in order to attack the servers. OTIP can prevent these attacks, or make them harder to succeed as the addresses collected by network sniffers expire in a short time. OTIP aims to provide one further layer of protection for private services.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>As the legal industry more readily leverages software for tools, automation, and predictive analytics, it has increased the affordable access to justice and legal services for underserved populations, helping make information and knowledge available for all. FOSS has and will continue to play a critical role in this evolution, but the line between where such software's functionality ends and the practice of law begins remains fuzzy. This presentation will discuss some of the legal precedent around Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) enforcement related to software, and will explore how current and future UPL enforcement may align or conflict with FOSS principles.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Since its advent in the late 1980s, the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community now has more than thirty years of experience in strategies for advocacy and encouraging adoption of FOSS.  Results have, unfortunately, been mixed.  While corporate adoption by for-profit companies has led to a boon and integration of FOSS into most corporate practices, the true promise of software rights and freedoms â the ability of individual hobbyist and consumers to participate on equal footing with the largest software producers in the world â mostly eludes our community.</p>\n\n<p>This talk examines the wins, losses and challenges that FOSS advocacy has faced in the last thirty years.  We'll explore how failures to foresee both web application deployment and the advent of advertising-based app-oriented software deployment led to serious strategic errors in advocacy and focus of attention.  Many of these problems remain difficult to address, and only frank discussion among activists will reveal new approaches to continue a vibrant FOSS community into the next generation.</p>",

      "title": "The coming EU Standard-Essential Patents regulation",
      "abstract": "<p>In early 2023, the European Commission will publish its proposal for a regulation on Standard-Essential Patents (SEPs) to address issues of legal uncertainty, the vulnerability of SMEs, and transaction costs. This regulation could bring some peace of mind, or it could make matters worse. While software patents are not enforced by courts in Europe, the European patent offices continue to grant software patents. And with the Unified Patent Court (UPC) possibly coming in 2023, European software developers are not safe from patent uncertainty.</p>",
      "description": "<p>In this presentation we will outline the European Commission's motivations, the input they're working from and the solutions they're considering. The Commission mentions FRAND licensing terms among the solutions, but, is it thinking of a type of FRAND licensing that truly doesn't discriminate against free software? We will discuss definitions for FRAND which could give real protections for free software and we will look into precedents which could be used as a basis for protecting the use, development and distribution of software against patents. Since the Commission's preparatory documents state \"legal certainty\" as one of the main objectives for this regulation, and knowing that software developers would like to be free from the current legal uncertainty around patents, we might be able to find a basis for agreement on a solution. If the EU institutions are serious about being fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory, and if they're serious about standards and interoperability, this could be our chance to get a regulation which ensures that patents never block free software from abiding by standards.</p>\n\n<p>This regulation will affect a large number of fields, including many fields where innovation is measured in how many patents were obtained this year.  Software risks being collateral damage in a bigger tug-o-war between industrial sectors.</p>\n\n<p>CiarÃ¡n O'Riordan, Senior Policy Advisor, OpenForum Europe</p>\n\n<p>Panos Alevropoulos, Administrator, End Software Patents</p>",

      "subtitle": "Practical tips for the reckless licensor",
      "abstract": "<p>Standards and specifications straddle the space between software and user-manualâstyle documentation.</p>\n\n<p>This session presents a recent case study of the search for an optimal license for a FOSS specification project. It covers establishing intrinsic goals for the specification itself, documenting interoperability concerns triggered by adjacent standards, and the difficulties posed by adopting or adapting licenses used in other free standards.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Specifications may be descriptive for human readers â like documentation â but may incorporate samples and pseudocode, or snippets that can be quoted within software source files â like a derived software program. For FOSS specifications, striking the ideal balance between permissiveness and fragmentation among implementers poses additional challenges. Though no one-size-fits-all solution exists, this session will compare specification-license strategies and explain how the case-study project resolved its own decision.</p>\n\n<p>The project in question is a specification for OpenType font shaping, but the licensing issues confronted are rather universal. It is a functional specification that attempts to serve as a reference for a variety of software implementations (both FOSS and otherwise) because predictable behavior across vendors is paramount, so there is no one, obvious license to pick for full compatibility. It interacts with prior standards published by other parties, such as Unicode and the multiple owners of OpenType, each of which carries its own license. And it seeks to attract support and buy-in from these outside parties, who may have competing interests.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the account of the project's search for potential licenses, the session will also look at the paucity of written resources or best-practices discussions dissecting the issues of specification licenses. It will also enumerate and compare the licenses used by other standards-publishers that impact FOSS developers, including the W3C, IEEE, IETF, and Internet Society, and will attempt to categorize the trade-offs made by each of these publishers. It will also discuss how specification licenses differ from other non-software licenses, such as licenses for datasets and general \"commons\" works.</p>\n\n<p>Attendees will come away with a renewed perspective on the questions facing authors of standards and specifications, as well as with up-to-date knowledge of how various specification publishers have described the rights granted and withheld in their licenses and the terms and conditions placed on their consumers. Discussion is encouraged, to distill some pertinent principles primed for practical processes.</p>\n\n<p>[Although the session relates to fonts and text encoding, no prior experience with font internals is required. Attendees should expect, however, to be shown the occasional UTF-8 or UTF-16 codepoint in the slides and be ready to avert their gaze if they feel unprepared.]</p>",

It will on board you to the idea of Multiplatform and what it means in terms of Kotlin and Rust each.\nThis also means it will explain some keyconcepts which are characterizing for the work with it in regard to your Multiplatform project.\nIt will show you, how you can use Rust and KMP on iOS, Web and of course Android. Also, it shares some pitfalls, workarounds and other lessons learned from failures with you.\nLetâs figure out if this is the beginning of a love story!</p>",

As well as mobile Android applications, desktop &amp; server applications are also ever growing in size; for example Compose for Desktop typically generates large application packages. JetBrains has recently integrated ProGuard into the Compose for Desktop Gradle plugin to tackle this issue.</p>\n\n<p>But what has changed and how does Kotlin affect shrinkers like ProGuard (which is 20 years old and originally created to process Java compiler produced bytecode)? How does ProGuard shrink classes produced by the Kotlin compiler? The Kotlin compiler just produces Java bytecode anyway, so nothing changes?</p>\n\n<p>The talk will take a look at ProGuard under the hood and what's required to process Kotlin apps &amp; libraries.

In this session you'll learn about Rust tools available to develop embedded firmware, linux gateways and cloud applications for Bluetooth mesh solutions.\nWe'll cover asynchronous embedded Rust with \"Embassy\" and \"Drogue device\" projects for writing firmwares and how to use them for mesh applications. Next, we'll explore the state of the mesh on Linux with \"Bluez\" and \"Bluer\" projects. We'll see how to use Rust and containers to develop mesh gateways. Finally, we'll describe the final piece needed to build end-to-end solutions, \"Drogue IoT cloud\".\nWith this we laid down the architecture and tools needed to build usable mesh applications. The session participants will get a good overview of the whole stack needed to build mesh IoT applications. They learn the benefits of Rust for building this kind of software and find good starting points to get going with their projects.</p>",

As such, it provides a great example of how to integrate the web experience in a Linux system, providing graphics integration through Wayland protocol.</p>\n\n<p>It will be a history of web engines. From QtWebKit, to QtWebEngine, to a custom embedding API directly on top of Chromium.</p>\n\n<p>This is also going to be a history of the flexibility of the platform, as it was possible to integrate it not only on webOS, but also in the different releases of Automotive Grade Linux, even after different architecture rewrites.

      "abstract": "<p>We will show-case how Eclipse KUKSA project can help to leverage the advantages of a standardized description of vehicle signals. A large challenge for automotive software is the lack of standardization inside a vehicle. The basic data fabric of a vehicle consists of \"signals\", such as for example the speed of the vehicle or the state of a door. For this kind of data traditionally there was no standardized way how it is represented or transmitted. This makes even seemingly simple end-to-end applications such as \"upload mileage to the cloud\" very hard and costly in the industry. With the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (https://covesa.github.io/vehicle<em>signal</em>specification/)  there exist an approach that is currently quickly adopted throughout the industry  addressing this by introducing a domain taxonomy for vehicle signals.</p>\n\n<p>KUKSA.val is an Open Source solution that helps transforming and serving such standardised signals inside a vehicle computer enabling faster development of reusable cross-fleet in-vehicle software.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The talk will show the architectural answer given by the Eclipse KUKSA project to leverage the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification inside a vehicle: We will show how to use KUKSA components to gather and transform the data from lower embedded layers in the vehicle, and  providing them in a secure way to apps and services.  We will take a look the APIs provided in KUKSA and touch upon questions of data security and privacy. This demonstrates  why within the context of the current Software Defined Vehicle Trend, Vehicle Computers are a worthwhile target for OSS solutions. A lot of benefit can be created by adopting standardised solutions for common challenges, laying a solid and cost-effective foundation for all kind of applications and services on top.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In this short tutorial you will learn how to remotely connect to embedded Linux devices running Wayland and Weston using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on GNU/Linux distributions built with the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded. Exact getting started steps will be provided. We will discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of RDP as well as some troubleshooting guidelines.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Wayland is an open source display server protocol aiming to replace X11 on Linux devices with a modern and secure windowing system. As of today most of the popular desktop Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora,  support Wayland out of the box. Wayland is also widely used on embedded devices and it is supported by hardware running Automotive Grade Linux (AGL), COVESA (previously GENIVI), WebOS, Tizen, postmarketOS, Jolla, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are many compositors compatible with Wayland. Weston is a simple reference compositor. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary network protocol with graphical user interface for connecting to other computers developed by Microsoft. It works on Weston with the screen-share.so plugin.</p>\n\n<p>This lightning talk will provide the exact steps how to build from scratch core-image-weston, setup RDP and remotely accesss the embedded device using wlfreerdp (for Wayland) or xfreerdp (for X11) from a personal computer with GNU/Linux distribution in the same network. The examples will be based on the long-term support release kirkstone of the Yocto Project.</p>\n\n<p>The talk is appropriate for anyone interested in remote access to embedded Linux devices. Previous experience is not required.</p>",

      "subtitle": "A Free-libre Respiration Ecosystem",
      "abstract": "<p>Public Invention is a non-profit that pivoted to human respiration during the pandemic. The PolyVent is a fully free-libre open mechanical ventilator educational platform for teaching and research. It is part of a proposed and partially implemented complete free ecosystem of medical devices for respiration called Freespireco. It runs VentOS free software which can drive any ventilator. These projects represent a burgeoning open source medical device movement.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Free-libre open design hardware grows out of free software. Hardware has greater capital costs than software and is much more expensive to deploy. Medical hardware is more expensive still. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 global pandemic showed that the fragility of our global supply chains kill people. Open source medical hardware is a potential solution to this predictable catastrophe. In coming decades, we hope it will be as common as free software is now.</p>\n\n<p>The PolyVent ventilator was started to address a predicted shortfall in human mechanical invasive and non-invasive ventilators in 2020. This never came to pass in the West, for medical reasons, but it was not a panicâit was a reasonable surmise based on limited data at the time. Over 100 teams tried to create open source ventilators; PolyVent is one of the few still active and fully open.</p>\n\n<p>The PolyVent is completely open and very modular to allow for educational tinkering and graduate-level research. It runs fully open software called VentOS which can drive any electromechanical ventilator based on an extensible hardware driver model. It uses a âsuper loopâ Arduino framework deployed with PlatformIO.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with other modules, such as the VentMon monitor which provides a clinical display in a public data lake and the GPAD (General Purpose Alarm Device), it is an educational platform that has been piloted at one University. Although not for clinical use, we hope for-profit firms will create clinical ventilators based on this design. We understand how to assist such firms in obtaining regulatory approval.</p>\n\n<p>Our hope is that in the next decade, a complete ecosystem of cooperating medical devices, components, data standards, and software, will make safe, reliable, reasonably priced respiratory care available to all people in all nations.</p>",

Without any knowledge of the modem stack it seemed impossibly difficult but now we are getting some insights into how it works it is possible to see how the binary blobs are doing stuff. The way forward was to run Android and capture all the calls made to the drivers. Sailfish have some of it working so their solution provided tools too.</p>\n\n<p>The fixes so far are very specific, every proprietary system has its own unique way of doing things. It is a horrible standard and no carrier even follows the standard. The modem is a black box with no outputs. To be honest, when it works, we donât know why it works. It works perfectly well though, so result. He would like to share his results, to discuss with the wider community how we can rolls this out to get more devices supported.</p>",

Yet, they still play a significant role in most ubiquitous types of programs, such as text processors, in-memory key-value stores, DNS resolvers, or codecs. Their burden on the performance of such programs becomes especially pronounced in distributed systems and cloud-native environments, where the number of strings within an instance of the software can reach an order of millions or more. This gives rise to performance issues and bottlenecks, especially with regard to memory consumption.</p>\n\n<p>To provide answers to these problems, the talk will discuss several string-optimization techniques. To be more accessible for both beginner and intermediate levels, the talk will first state the problem and briefly introduce strings as a data structure, and will explain how strings look internally in Go. The core of the presentation will be dedicated to discussing operations with strings and how these can be optimized based on various techniques, such as string interning and string concatenation. The author will also share his experience and practical examples of open-source programs, where these techniques are being applied.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The reconciliation pattern is a design pattern that is commonly used in Kubernetes to ensure that the desired state of a system is consistently maintained. It involves continuously monitoring the state of the system and making adjustments as needed to ensure that it remains in compliance with the desired state. Reconciliation is one of the key patterns that emerge from control theory, which is a branch of engineering that deals with the design and analysis of systems that control the behavior of dynamic processes.\nReconcilers are the heart of Kubernetes and Cluster API. The use of reconcilers in Kubernetes enables users to define the desired state of their clusters declaratively, and let Kubernetes handle the details of implementing and maintaining that state. The reconciliation pattern in Go is implemented by using the Kubernetes API to track the state of the cluster, and Go's concurrency features to ensure that the reconciler runs continuously and can make adjustments in real time.\nWe will take a look into the implementation of these patterns in their nascent form and then their extension in Cluster API by the use of controllers.</p>",

Headscale implements this control server and allows self-hosters and open source aficionados to use Tailscaleâs clients without having to use a closed source product.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we will tell the story of how we started reimplementing the control server based on the code from Tailscaleâs official client. We went through stages of âman this works surprisingly wellâ to âhow does this even workâ after we started to use aggressive integration testing to improve the âcorrectnessâ of our implementation. For every test we added, we found tons of issues to fix, and eventually, we got to a stage where we could improve headscale with great confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Today, integration testing is potentially the most vital part of our development cycle and we both use it to fix âold and brokenâ, and add ânew and shinyâ.\nWe have managed to take what started out as a learning project to understand how Tailscale worked and built it into a healthy open source project and community.</p>",

But oh boy, they were right; it was crazy indeed:</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I would like to take you on a journey of the less common and crazier parts of Go: You will learn about pure-assembly optimizations, obscure pitfalls, tricks of heap allocations, and memory management in general.</p>",

They must also launch the container payload as quickly as possible. Hardware virtualization-based containers typically run on top of simplified and customized Linux kernels to minimize the overall guest boot time. As such, we introduced the td-shim to replace the traditional Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) based TDVF for container use case.\nCurrently the rust-based td-shim supports multiple hypervisors such as KVM and cloud hypervisor with smaller size and better boot performance. It provides a secure and efficient way of building the cloud native infrastructure.</p>",

      "title": "A Study of Fine-Grain Compartment Interface Vulnerabilities: What, Why, and What We Should Do About Them",
      "abstract": "<p>Software compartmentalization decomposes applications into lesser-privileged\ncomponents that only have access to what they need to do their job. Properly\napplied, compartmentalization can limit the impact of many memory safety issues\nby containing corruption within the vulnerable component. Use-cases are\nplentiful: library sandboxing, protection of SSL keys, sandboxing of\nnetwork-facing code, and more.</p>\n\n<p>In the last decade we have seen the appearance of many new mechanisms that\nenable compartmentalization at a relatively low performance cost (Intel PKU,\nthe upcoming Intel PKS, CHERI hardware capabilities, vmfunc). This generated a\nlot of research with a strong focus on compartmentalizing existing software, at\na fine grain (isolating libraries or components), and as automatically as\npossible.  The promises are great: the compartmentalization of legacy software,\nwith a low engineering effort, and at a low performance cost.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, in this process, the interfaces between compartments are often neglected:\nthey are hard to reason about and difficult to secure automatically, and\ncompartmentalizing at finer and finer-grain exacerbates the issue. This is a\nmajor problem, as weak interfaces enable for many attacks well-known in the\nconfidential computing world.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk I will present the result of a study on the impact of neglecting\ncompartment interfaces. I will define and classify compartment interface\nvulnerabilities, and present a fuzzer specialized to catch them. Having applied\nit to 25 popular applications and 36 possible compartment APIs, revealing 629\ninterface vulnerabilities, I will present insights into what makes interfaces\nvulnerable, and how to make them more resilient when compartmentalizing.</p>",

Few of the features being, enabling CPU and NUMA topology, support more syscalls and adding Vtune profiling support. In addition, we have also enhanced our GSC (Gramine shielded Containers) tool to deploy Docker containers protected by Intel SGX enclaves.

      "abstract": "<p>In the last two years, we have examined over 180 research projects that develop, refine and use software related to energy in buildings and neighborhoods. These projects originate from Germany and are funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. The aim of this presentation is to give an overview of relevant research fields and related software, missing software building blocks and to talk about the relationship of software developed and used by the projects to open source.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation we give an overview of the different relevant topics (especially simulations and monitoring) and the related software. We further state why there is a need to develop open sourcealterantives for them. Based on this, we state reasons for the existing challenges  for (research) software in the field of building energy technology. We discuss approaches to solutions and provide impulses for relevant software that is currently lacking.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Emissions from buildings are one of the biggest drivers of global climate change. Refurbishment, changes in use and operation, or adapted planning are ways to reduce these emissions. In order to achieve this goal, researchers worldwide are developing numerous ideas and corresponding software. Our analysis of the German landscape shows that even if criteria for open source and open science are met, much of this software is not reused, resulting in parallel developments. In addition to heterogeneity in the infrastructure, there is also a lack of individual building blocks in open-source software chains (e.g. solvers) that are needed to implement use cases. We describe ideas and approaches to close these gaps.</p>",

This talk will give an introduction to the fundamentals and requirements of the calibration law and explain you why Open Source of the \"Chargy Transparency Software\" is not only eyecandy, but a fundamental part of the security goals and guarantees for EV drivers.</p>",
      "description": "<p>From a software developer's point of view the German calibration law is not so much about measuring energy correctly or invoicing the correct prices, but a first step towards a more modern zero trust architecture for the e-mobility charging infrastructure. This security update is sorely needed, as todays architecture is full of well-known, yet unaddressed bugs and design flaws mainly caused by the very the bad communication of people in distributed systems and across gated communities.</p>\n\n<p>Besides solving technical goals, the German Eichrecht also tries to make sure, that the security gurantees also reach the end users and give them all required tools, data and information to verify the correctness of their charging sessions. Therefore for us Open Source is not only a non-functional, nice-to-have marketing feature off the calibration law or just more cost effective way of shared software development, but a fundamental (functional) requirement. Unfortunately the applicability of the calibration law for those end users is still very low. With the upcoming version 2.x of our Chary Transparency Software we not only introduce multi-language support to support the adoption of the German Eichrecht all over Europe, but also present new services like a real public key infrastructure for energy meter public keys and incremental charge transparency records for a \"Real-Time Eichrecht\".</p>\n\n<p>Of course we are interested in your feedback and future contributions to this Open Source Project.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Power grid substation automation is moving toward virtualization. In order to facilitate this transition, it is necessary to have a reference design and industrial grade open source real-time platform that can run virtualized automation and protection applications (for the power grid industry and potentially beyond).\nThat is why RTE, Alliander and Savoir-faire Linux created SEAPATH project under the governance of Linux Foundation Energy.</p>\n\n<p>Several solutions already exist, but they cover only part of the needs. That's why the project aims to assemble the right packages with as few specific developments as possible. The effort is put on testing to ensure that all the parts, hardware and software fulfill the needs for critical system.</p>\n\n<p>The presentation will be about the platform itself with virtualization, high availability and cybersecurity features, and also about the test process based on the IEC61850 standard that will validate that the platform can indeed host automation and protection applications.</p>",

However in a world with limited resources this becomes a growing concern, especially as developers cannot cater to this need since the appropriate tools are currently lacking.</p>\n\n<p>The Green Metrics Tool is an open source framework that allows for measuring, comparing and optimizing the energy consumption of arbitrary software. The goal is to empower both software engineers and users to make educated decisions about libraries, code-snippets and software in order to save energy and thus carbon emissions.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Any application will be containerized and then analyzed by its logical parts. The open source tool measures classical performance metrics as well as energy related metrics like wattage, temperature and cooling efficiency to understand what part of the software is responsible for which part of the energy consumption.</p>\n\n<p>Through the concept of usage scenarios we create an interface for developers to test/develop against. In the end this makes complex software products comparable to each other and thus enables developers to select libraries based on their functionality-energy-profile (for instance messages per Watt or similar).</p>\n\n<p>We present the roadmap for this tool over the next year, which will result in a public and open database of energy information for arbitrary hardware setups, code blocks and libraries and a green standard library / green code completion.</p>",

Autoscalers and schedulers really need pod-level metrics data in order to obtain energy savings from resizing or migrating containers.</p>\n\n<p>The presentation introduces Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler) and its integration with Kubernetes. By leveraging eBPF programs, Kepler probes per container energy consumption related system counters and exports them as metrics. These metrics help end users observe their containersâ energy consumption and allow cluster admins to make intelligent decisions on achieving energy conservation goals. The presentation shows that Kepler can be easily integrated into Prometheus and render time series metrics into Grafana.</p>\n\n<p>At last, we will demonstrate sustainable management of clusters by leveraging Cloud-native patterns, Observability and Kubernetes features like node selector, node labels, node name, affinity and anti-affinity to achieve carbon intensity aware placement of workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.</p>",

      "title": "Using GNU Guix Containers with FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) Support",
      "abstract": "<p>The GNU Guix package manager/distribution provides its own containers as part of a more general tool, 'guix shell' for quick one-off or repeatable environments. The container option is isolated from the host system, with options to expose directories, network interfaces, and so on. This is an excellent tool for isolating software in a completely controlled and reproducible environment in a minimal way. Recently, we added an option to emulate the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) within the container, so that this environment looks like a more \"typical\" distribution with a global '/lib', '/bin', etc., unlike a Guix system. This is helpful for developing or running software which expects or assumes an FHS file layout. For example, many language environments want to manage their own tools and download binaries, or some software isn't yet packagable for Guix, like a fully source and bootstrapable JavaScript application. These would otherwise be very difficult to use in Guix and now we can do so in an (isolated) environment. This talk will introduce 'guix shell' and the container and emulate-FHS options with examples of real-world use.</p>",

The common tasks of such a user range from information retrieval of a publication to easy tagging and searching the user's own library. Several libre and proprietary software packages exist. The package Papis consists of an extendable Python library, a flexible command-line interface and a simple (but powerful) data model. This in turn, empowers the user to curate her library metadata in a future-proof and privacy-respecting manner. Papis users are encouraged and empowered by a clear API to write scripts and libraries to extend the core functionality. All major text editors have an interface to Papis and a web-application for remote access to the user's libraries is also in place.  Additionally, during the last 7 years we have built a vibrant community of academic and industry researchers that have become happy users and avid contributors.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>With roughly 20 billion monthly pageviews, 15 million monthly edits, and almost 55 million articles across 300+ languages, Wikipedia and its sister projects are an essential part of the free Knowledge ecosystem. These projects are created and maintained by a vast network of volunteers.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization operating Wikipedia, has a Research team of scientists, engineers, and community developers. They use data and scientific methods to support the needs and advance the understanding of the Wikimedia projects, their readers and their contributors. To expand the team's  capacity and breadth of expertise, a focus area of the team is to improve the social and technical infrastructure  that helps the broader Wikimedia Movement and research community to tackle complex research challenges.\nIn this talk, members of the Wikimedia Foundationâs Research team will give an overview of their recent efforts to support the community of researchers working on Wikimedia projects. Specifically, they will discuss i) the generation of open data resources; ii) tools for working with open Wikimedia data; and iii) building and releasing machine-learning models to support Wikimedia projects. The goal of this talk is to demonstrate to open tool developers and researchers how to leverage these resources and contribute to the Wikimedia Research community.</p>",

Open source culture has demonstrated how transparent and collaborative innovation can support modern digital services, data and infrastructure. Open Source Software (OSS) accelerates the transition to a sustainable economy by supporting traceable decision-making, building capacity for localisation and customisation of climate technologies, and most importantly, helping to prevent greenwashing. Despite the transformative impact of open source culture, its potential for developing environmentally sustainable technologies is not well understood.</p>\n\n<p>This study provides the first analysis of the open source software ecosystem in the field of sustainability and climate technology. Thousands of actively developed open source projects and organizations were collected and systematically analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods as part of the Open Sustainable Technology project. The analysis covers multiple dimensions â including the technical, the social, and the organisational. It highlights key risks and challenges for users, developers, and decision-makers as well as opportunities for more systemic collaboration. Based on these unique insights, we were also able to define the Open Sustainability Principles that embody open source in sustainability.</p>",

The current incarnation of Rosegarden for Linux was kick-started in 2001 by Chris Cannam, Guillaume Laurent and Richard Bown. In this talk, one of the original creators of this legendary piece of OSS history takes you through the project's history and analyses some of the critical elements for its continued success to this day.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The 'current' version of Rosegarden was actually a complete bottom-up rewrite that started in 2001. The previous incarnation (Rosegarden 2.1) was initially written for IRIX and then ported to other UNIX variants, including in 1995, Linux. The current version has not significantly changed since its original architecture was settled in 2001-2004. What's so good about it that keeps it working to this day? How many people are working on it now? And what do current users think of the project and where is it going next?</p>\n\n<p>Join Richard for an entertaining and exciting ride through Linux audio history as well as the history and architecture of Rosegarden.</p>",

      "subtitle": "The Plumbers Experience",
      "abstract": "<p>Over the pandemic years, conference organizers have had a crash course in running online events, but now that the world is returning to normality, they're under pressure to keep the on-line portion of the conference for a hybrid remote/local event.  Linux Plumbers Conference is a usually in-person event that specializes in direct in-person interactions as well as more traditional presentations.  This year was the first time we tried to take our on-line infrastructure and repurpose it for hybrid in Dublin in September.  One of the big factors in running a hybrid conference is that it's no longer just the committee and a server farm, you have a venue, a local audio team, an external A/V handler and the technology all to plumb into a seamless experience.</p>\n\n<p>Plumbers online was based on BigBlue Button and Matrix, which is what we also used for hybrid.  This presentation will be the story of how it was put together, how the in-person and local components were designed to interact, how it worked in the field and, although plumbers received universal acclaim for being one of the most successful hybrid conferences, the many things that went wrong during the conference and how we surmounted, or at least worked around, them.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Our technology infrastructure was set up identically to virtual: BigBlue Button (BBB) handling the audio/video but with the in BBB chat element replaced by matrix.  The reason we have an external A/V company in the mix above is because we've always done streaming from the in-person conference, and this was planned to be our free tier of the conference; view the stream and be able to interact with the room chat over matrix.  We've discussed before [1] the scaling problems of this setup (and so won't go over scaling in this presentation), but we'd fixed this in virtual and had no scaling issues in hybrid.  Of great importance to getting the interaction to function was audience training.  We used the same methodology for virtual (essentially only unmute your video if you want to interject) and hybrid, so we already had the on-line training ready to go.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the on=site issues were caused by the steep learning curve the external A/V company had to go through to manage the room BBB console as well as getting the in room sound setup correct (onsite audio isn't used to having a remote feed, but they can be persuaded to treat it like an audio feed from the presenter).  Our biggest problem actually turned out to be the size of our onsite committee tech team (2 people) which was insufficient to the number of live rooms (six) we were running.</p>\n\n<p>[1] https://blog.hansenpartnership.com/linux-plumbers-conference-matrix-and-bbb-integration/</p>",

      "description": "<p>During 2022 we've been on a mission to completely rework the slowest bits of Matrix, aiming that nobody can ever complain about Matrix being sluggish again. In practice this means fundamental changes in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>how Matrix syncs data - \"sliding sync\", where servers only sync the bare minimum data to clients required to render the UI, providing instant login and instant sync (MSC3575)</p></li>\n<li><p>how room joins work over federation - \"faster joins\", where servers only sync the bare minimum data such that clients can start participating in the room as soon as possible  (MSC3902)</p></li>\n<li><p>how auth works - switching Matrix to use OIDC natively for all authentication, registration and account management (MSC3861)</p></li>\n<li><p>how VoIP works - switching Matrix to natively support multiparty decentralised E2EE VoIP as the primary calling mechanism (MSC3401 and MSC3898)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>The end result is transformational, and by far the biggest change to Matrix since the project began in 2014. So, we're calling it Matrix 2.0, and this talk will give a guided tour of everything that's changed - and show off the new reference matrix-rust-sdk client SDK, which powers the new flagship mobile Matrix client, codenamed Element X.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Cryptography is undergoing a renaissance and explosion in algorithms that open up entirely new design spaces. Techniques such as zero-knowledge snarks, multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption allow us to create software that just 5 years ago was unimaginable. This unlocks a new field that we term anonymous engineering.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will briefly explain how they work from a high level mathematical overview, present the abstraction they provide and show how they can be composed into applications. We will also show demos of writing ZK proofs and deploying them in our software.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The original designers of UNIX in the 80s had a vision of computing which would allow groups of people to collaborate. From that vision was born the modern conceptualisations of networking, multi-user accounts, filesystems and multi-process OS. But they were limited at the time by the computer resources available, the network bandwidth and the algorithms. Since then the paradigm of computing has remained largely stagnant.</p>\n\n<p>Also the Linux world after many setbacks is doing soulsearching and trying to understand what made us truly unique, getting back to first principles and our original values. We believe the time is ripe for the grand mission of reinventing the paradigm of computing. Recent developments in p2p &amp; consensus algorithms, and crypto algorithms in particular ZK lay the groundwork for us to extend the original vision of the UNIX creators much further. Our wish is to draw the attention of the free software community to these magical and important developments.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, we want to also present the software stack that we are creating. Our team at DarkFi has created:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Anonymous transfers</li>\n<li>Anonymous exchange</li>\n<li>Anonymous DAO (treasury management where participants have voting rights)</li>\n<li>Encrypted task manager</li>\n<li>Anonymous chat software with spam protection (no registration, uses ZK proofs)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>All of this software is p2p and censorship resistant. We will explain other potential software designs such as authentication of information, anonymous auctions, proof of reserves, private statistical processing of info, and more.</p>",

It provides you the opportunity to be your own boss and control your destiny, while working on something that you are passionate about that can make a positive impact on the world. A startup, however, is different in that it's expected to grow rapidly and reach a high level of revenue, often raising money from investors to expedite this growth. There are many ways to start successful businesses, and a rapid growth startup is only one of them.</p>\n\n<p>Open source startups are great for the open source community, and we will all benefit from having more of them started. They bring in more contributors, and enable more people to work on open source software full time, making for more quality open source software. Successful open source startups also tend to contribute to upstream projects, both financially and with code contributions, making the whole ecosystem better. While there is a lot of information online about starting your own startup, there is much less information about starting open source ones.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk Tom will talk about why you should or should not start an open source startup, and what you need to consider when building an open source startup, covering topics such as fundraising, business model, product, and more. Tom will draw examples from his experience building two successful open source businesses, one of which has raised over $10m in venture capital, and the experiences of fellow founders of other successful open source startups.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Free and Open Source Software âwonââit successfully democratized access to code and technologyâbut the industry changed. Cloud computing has created an always online, software-defined world orchestrated around running software-as-a-service. This reintroduced practical limits to software freedom as hyperscalers create proprietary differentiation through secretive operation and management software. In practice, we have become dependent on proprietary services built on a FOSS foundation. This proprietary capture threatens to undermine the very ability to create Free and Open Source Software. This presentation explores suggestions (such as the Operate First initiative) for how FOSS can, and must, evolve to face these challenges and democratize the cloud.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Free and Open Source Software has successfully democratized access to code and technology. FOSS has become  the common, universal base for software development. However, despite âwinningâ the industry, FOSS largely stops with 'software at rest' (the runtimes, toolchains, and code components used when running your environment and building your applications). Upstream projects can take these software components and run them, but putting them into production at scale is mostly protected as proprietary knowledge by the companies offering cloud services on top of FOSS.</p>\n\n<p> FOSS enabled the evolution of computing through cloud and microservices, as well as the increasing ubiquity of software control in the physical world. With this widespread adoption the challenges to FOSS have changed: the software industry has remade development into the aggregation of black-box services running on infrastructure controlled by a third party. It has, in essence, re-created the problem of the mainframe. To survive, FOSS must evolve through open sourcing operations. Operate First is one way to do that.</p>",

This is possible since FOSSBot is made of electronic materials that can be easily found commercially at a low cost while the plastic parts are printable.\nIt provides four main operation modes: i) a UI with buttons that is suitable for preschool children and shows the main capabilities of the robot, for example moving the robot forward or backward, or turning clockwise and anti-clockwise, ii) a block-based graphical programming interface (based on Google Blockly) aimed at primary school students, iii) a notebook coding interface that can be used for teaching high school students and elementary school students the fundamentals of Python programming (such as loops, conditions, events, etc.), iv) a Python coding mode, which allows to directly work into the FOSSBot programming shell and gives direct control to the low-level electronics.</p>\n\n<p>The software of FOSSbot is based on a modular stack that allows the implementation the various programming functions, orchestrates everything through the UI, and controls the hardware in an easy way through a software library that plays the role of the FOSSBot operating system. This stack includes Google Blockly, Python Jupyter, Python Flask which hosts FOSSBot's UI, the core FOSSBot library written in Python which controls the bot's hardware, and finally the manual operation it offers to users through a user interface, i.e. a way to control the robot without any programming knowledge.\nFOSSBot's software is built using the latest versions of the above technologies, including Docker, continuous integration, and microservices integration (CI) logic. As mentioned in the introduction, programming the robot can be done in different ways which are followed and analyzed.</p>\n\n<p>The hardware is based on a Raspberry-Pi zero that controls everything and a set of electronics comprising:\n- Sensors: Ultrasonic distance sensor, Battery Sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Odometers, IR Receiver, Line detection sensors, Light Sensors\n- Interaction Features: Speaker and Front RGB LED\n- General Features: Brick-compatible surface, Hole in the front for attaching a marker/pencil, a special pulling loop, rechargeable batteries</p>\n\n<p>All the plastic parts, except the wheels, are printable on a 3D printer and the total printing time does not exceed 36 hours. It is worth mentioning that the body of the robot has been designed in such a way as to facilitate its assembly process. This has been achieved since cases have been designed inside the robot, and adapted to the electronic components so that they are placed in the corresponding positions and do not move during the use of the robot. Also, on the outer surface, there are printed symbols that indicate the position of each sensor. The symbols also help teachers to know the position of the sensors, e.g. speaker, led, etc. The vertical tube that runs from top to bottom of the main body of the robot allows for the attachment of a pencil or marker so that by moving the FOSSBot around an area covered with paper, shapes can be created.\nPrinted meshes on the front and top of the robot help keep electrical parts cool. The robot's charging port, on/off switch, and a unique loop for towing small items are all located on the back. The loop also serves to protect the robot from minor collisions. Two printed spoilers above the wheels add to wheel protection and to the robot's aesthetic design.\nThe top surface of the robot is divided into two pieces. A cover that attaches to the main body using unique clips is the original accessory. The main cover can be joined to the top cover using an easy twist-and-lock function. It can be easily removed to give access to the interior of the robot and can also support a base of plastic bricks, allowing bricks to be added on top of the robot. This option enables lower-grade teachers to combine FOSSBot with other projects and can help add new activities to FOSSBot.</p>\n\n<p>Printing and assembly instructions and figures can be found in this manual: https://github.com/eellak/fossbot/blob/master/electronics<em>instructions/draft</em>instructions.pdf</p>\n\n<p>Educators' supporting material is under development.</p>",

Nym does this by mixing internet packets at nodes so they do not exit the mixnet in FIFO, as well as adding fake traffic. Like Tor, any application and use SOCKS proxies to bind to Nym. As Nym is built in Rust, it also allows WebSockets and other direct integration. We can demonstrate how the Nym mix network hides network-level metadata from everything from Bitcoin to Telegram.</p>",

Although the original project was started by a Neuchatel-based startup, the project takes contributions from volunteers. Mix nodes are ran in a decentralized manner and keep track of their reputation using the NYM token. Currently, there are approximately 500 mix nodes, but new nodes and applications are welcome. Nym works well for asynchronous, message-based traffic like instant messaging and e-mail, while Tor works better for synchronous, circuit-based traffic like Web browsing. Both projects should be able to work together to provide full-privacy for users.</p>",

There are now open-source competitors for almost any proprietary productivity, project and knowledge management, and other digital tools.\nBut to fully take advantage of open-source so far required at least basic coding knowledge -- without it, one is not able to fork or self-host the software, and is confined to using the cloud version only.\nOpen-source PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) solutions such as Caprover and Gardens offer a way out. They allow to easily host server-side or web-apps through the UI or CLI, and automate most of the complexity usually associated with setting up and maintaining self-hosted software.

Being a fully documented and transparent design is a core value of the project, ensuring mainline kernel integration with no effort wasted on reversing-engineering proprietary designs covered by NDA (non-disclosure-agreements), while avoiding untrusted binary blobs. The products should âjust workâ, at its maximum performance and feature set, with full involvement and support for the community.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Libre-SOC labored to produce its first silicon, a test chip, and produced its first Linux-capable networked proof of concept on an FPGA (field programmable gate array) development board. Using a completely FLOSS toolchain, any developer can build and test this design on their own computer, run it in hardware in a supported FPGA development board, or even build a full ASIC chip layout.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk Iâll present topics of the ongoing architecture design and formal testing, being written in a modern, developer-friendly, Python-based hardware description language.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Internet-based data sources and resources continue to grow exponentially, making the mechanisms for searching and discovering insights, and making sense of data, a crucial field of research.</p>\n\n<p>Our talk will present two sister projects, Next Generation Internet (NGI) Search and OpenWebSearch.\nThe objective of the former is to support innovative projects to develop trustworthy solutions towards the development of new ways of searching data by addressing the challenges of power cognitive search, natural language processing, and social computing amongst other cutting-edge fields through five Open Calls. The projects will be compliant with open, collaborative and unbiased values.\nOn the other hand, NGI OpenWebSearch has its origins in concerns over the imbalance of the search engine market, that are dominated and limited by a few gatekeepers.  Thus, information as public good, with free, unbiased, and transparent access is not under public control anymore. Over the next three years the researchers will develop the core of a European Open Web Index (OWI) as a basis for a new Internet Search in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Both projects will lead to more transparency and choice with a focus on privacy and trust, contributing to the overall vision of a more human-centric Internet.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>What is an IDS and Network Security Monitoring in 2023?\nMonitoring, Detection, challenges and solutions while chasing APTs, CVEs and Ransomware.</p>\n\n<p>Challenges keep raising the bar for the security monitoring systems to deal with. From limiting visibility resulting to more and wider encryption adoption to log volumes, to sophistication and amplification of malware attacks and threat actors.\nWhen multiple systems and integrations are involved the defenders are even more overwhelmed with engineering related tasks.</p>\n\n<p>APTs and malware actors use any means necessary at their disposal. So should the blue teams around the globe.\nThe need for more visibility and faster response arises dramatically. Being able to have full network forensic evidence - including protocol, flow file transactions and packet capture to support the IDS generated alerts - is essential for defenders. However the sheer volume and infra needs can be prohibitive for many deployments scenarios as it is not always only related to just cost. If Open Standard is a key element in lowering the cost and complexity of integration, information sharing is a key element in getting fast detection and reaction.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we will walk through some of the challenges that Suricata faces and has solved as it keeps evolving. All that while doing an actual hands on review of real life examples of CVEs exploits and APT, Ransomware proliferation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>CNI plugins â we love them for getting our Kubernetes networking untangled. Sometimes â we want to manage them in a more cloud-native fashion, using Kubernetes itself. Doug is here to guide you on a tour of a proof-of-concept CNI plugin, one that automagically probes your nodes for devices, and allows you (or your Kubernetes controllers! Or your AI/ML!?) to add semantics to your Kubernetes network attachment â and help you answer the question: âWhich network am I really attaching my pods to?â, letting you express how to map your pod networking to devices, and to networks themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Today, when you use the reference CNI plugins, such as macvlan and ipvlan CNI, youâre given a kind of magical power: Using native Linux capabilities for networking your workloads in Kubernetes. This is low level and powerful. We all know that networking isnât simple when youâre in the real world, thereâs lots of existing infrastructure and grim realities of data centers. Flexibility is clutch here, and low level solutions help us to build towards these realities. However, Kubernetes is meant for scale, and for expression of intent at a higher level. This approach is an example of how we can meet these requirements for low-level definitions of our network attachments to meet Kubernetes goal of large scale â especially at scale and in non-uniform server environments.</p>",
      "description": "<p>This talk will encompass a demo of a brand new CNI plugin and auxiliary components which allow you to map devices to networks, and associate your pods attachments to devices at a higher level, with more automagic, so you donât have to baby the workload specifications at the lowest possible level, and take advantage of how Kubernetes can help you orchestrate these attachments.</p>\n\n<p>Youâll learn a lot about CNI! Youâll get instructions to take home on how to get this CNI plugin running in your own lab, and itâll give you a test bed for learning how to make your own CNI plugins too. Even if youâre not a CNI plugin developer, itâll help you understand better what your CNI plugins are doing, and help you diagnose issues in your own Kubernetes deployment. Weâll also talk about device plugins for Kubernetes and youâll get to learn about how device availability impacts scheduling workloads.</p>\n\n<p>While this talk encourages you to get into the nitty gritty of CNI â Doug really wants to invite you to become a participant in bigger picture efforts for the Kubernetes networking community, too. There is a nascent Kubernetes-native MultiNetworking effort, the Kubernetes Network Plumbing Working Group, and upcoming work for CNI 2.0. This talk, and PoC project represents some problems that we need to solve as a community â If we donât represent the community and what we all want â we lose out to the commercial efforts which will steamroll the community and leave our (already overtaxed!) sysadmins in the dirt. We all need common ground to work together upon, and itâs up to the community to set those standards and let the commercial efforts follow.</p>\n\n<p>CNI is the âContainer Networking Interfaceâ, and itâs an API for setting up networking for containers, and also used by Kubernetes. We love it for its simplicity, and for the fact that itâs a common ground for networking in Kubernetes, and we already know, container networking isnât always easy. What you might not know is that CNI itself is âcontainer orchestration engine agnostic.â For a 1.0, this limitation makes sense, and we need to respect the origins of this thinking, and it allows some overarching constructs that are useful for both orchestration engines, and container runtimes (like crio and containerd), but we need a step forward in terms of Kubernetes given how ubiquitous itâs become, and continues to become in the networking space.</p>\n\n<p>Doug believes that we need an evolution, or potentially, a revolution for CNI 2.0. One that gives us a layer to speak to CNI using Kubernetes. If we donât have this pathway, it encourages developers to ignore CNI and build their own Rube Goldberg machine, and sysadmins have already had to chase the rolling ball down the chute to light the match to drop the mousetrap enough as it is. We need standards, not contraptions!</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The emergence of heterogeneous hardware resources has posed a significant obstacle for the Java programming language to keep up with the âWrite Once Run Anywhereâ paradigm. The reality is that several parts of the Java Virtual Machine must be modified to make Java portable for execution on modern heterogeneous hardware, such as GPUs and FPGAs. To tackle that challenge, TornadoVM is implemented in the University of Manchester as an open-source software technology that enables OpenJDK and other JDK distributions to offload parts of Java applications onto heterogeneous hardware for parallel execution.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will present the latest features of TornadoVM, and it will showcase examples of how the TornadoVM API can be utilized to abstract heterogeneous hardware and increase the performance of Java applications. The goal is to explain the basic terms of TornadoVM including all new API extensions, in order for developers to take advantage of heterogeneous hardware with minimal effort. Finally, this presentation will discuss how TornadoVM is used in research and industry for the acceleration of Java applications.</p>",

However, in a container world, the performance gains are often negated due to CPU and memory consumption constraints. To help solve this issue, the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM provides JITServer technology, which separates the JIT compiler from the application.</p>\n\n<p>JITServer allows the user to employ much smaller containers enabling a higher density of applications, resulting in cost savings for end-users and/or cloud providers. Because the CPU and memory surges due to JIT compilation are eliminated, the user has a much easier task of provisioning resources for his/her application. Additional advantages include: faster ramp-up time, better control over resources devoted to compilation, increased reliability (JIT compiler bugs no longer crash the application) and amortization of compilation costs across many application instances.</p>\n\n<p>We will dig into JITServer technology, showing the challenges of implementation, detailing its strengths and weaknesses and illustrating its performance characteristics. For the cloud audience we will show how it can be deployed in containers, demonstrate its advantages compared to a traditional JIT compilation technique and offer practical recommendations about when to use this technology.</p>",

This move had its reasons, but it resulted in a number of significant performance degradations in existing code. Thus, when non-contended locking optimization can be added, it still benefits virtual machines. Parallel stop-the-world garbage collection is one of the earliest GC variants in HotSpot, and yet it is the best choice in terms of high throughput.\nSubstrateVM which powers GraalVM native image supports synchronization monitors and offers serial stop-the-world GC as a basic collector. Due to the increased popularity of pre-compilation and its support in modern frameworks, it is remarkable how playing classical optimization pieces helps to improve the performance of such code.\nBellSoft recently put locking and garbage collection enhancements for public review. It is interesting that within GraalVM project both were implemented in Java. We'll explore implementation details, benchmark results, and application benefits.</p>",

Quarkus is not just useful for optimizing resource usage though.  There is also a big focus on improving the developer experience.  In this session we'll demonstrate how Quarkus is very easy to work with and allows developers to work with containers and external dependencies such as databases, Kafka clusters, Kubernetes etc without being experts in any of these technologies.<br/>\nAfter this session, the audience should come away with inspiration to build modern Cloud Native applications with Java, and have fun doing so!</p>",

Algebraic effects provide a means to\nmanage non-functional side-effects of calls, while type features provide means\nto attach logic to type parameters providing more power to generic types.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will explain algebraic effects and type features in Fuzion and show\nhow they can be used.

Many examples\nwill be given that show how typical code patterns in Java can be realized in a\npurely functional way using effects and type features.</p>",
      "description": "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts\nfound in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into\nthe concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety\nfeatures based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate\nrepresentation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis\ntools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Algebraic effects are a relatively new mechanism currently in use in some\nresearch programming languages to make side-effects explicit.  The motivation\nfor this is to make any side-effects explicit and use this information either\nfor security analysis or to permit optimizations, e.g. to automatically detect\nredundant calls or potential for parallelism.  An analysis of side-effects of\nlibrary code could have made it clear early on that code contains the log4shell\nvulnerability by exposing the side effects of network access and possible\nloading of code.</p>\n\n<h1>Algebraic Effects</h1>\n\n<p>Algebraic Effects are sets of operations that encapsulate a side-effect in a way\nthat is orthogonal to otherwise purely functional code.  Algebraic effects\nrepresent values that are additional implicit arguments and results of functions\nthat depend on an operation provided by an effect.</p>\n\n<p>Such functions must be called with an instance of the effect available in the\nenvironment they are called from.  Effects can be installed for a certain region\nof code.  Regions using given effects can be nested and inner regions may\nreplace the effects installed in surrounding regions.</p>\n\n<p>When an operations of an effect is performed, say <code>read</code> on a file-I/O effect,\nthat effect typically returns with a result, in this case the byte read.  Is is\nsaid that the caller resumes operation with the result value.  However, an\noperation may as well abort a calculation, which means that it will not return a\nresult but continue execution at the end of the region for which the effect was\ninstalled.  In the general case, the operation of an effect may resume with 0,\n1, or more results, while the effect is responsible of joining the resulting 0,\n1, or more execution paths.</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, Java's exception mechanism has a lot in common with effects: The\n<code>try</code>-block defines the region, while <code>throw</code> corresponds to aborting an\noperation and the <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code> clauses perform the required code to\nproduce a result from a resumed or aborted operation.</p>\n\n<h1>Effects in Fuzion</h1>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, effects are Fuzion features that inherit from base library feature\n<code>effect</code> and define their operations as inner features.  Effects are identified\nby their type. Imagine we define an effect <code>x</code> that provides an operation <code>y</code>,\nthen we would do</p>\n\n<pre><code>x : effect is\n  y(arg some_type) =&gt; ...some operation...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A feature <code>f</code> using effect <code>x</code> to perform operation <code>y</code> given value <code>v</code> would then write</p>\n\n<pre><code>f =&gt;\n  ...\n  x.env.y v\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This means that effect <code>x</code> is taken from the current environment to call\noperation <code>y v</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Before <code>f</code> can be called, we must install an instance of <code>x</code>. This can be done as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x.use ()-&gt;f\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>x</code> creates this instance and <code>use</code> installs it while executing the\nprovided lambda <code>()-&gt;f</code>, which in this case does nothing but call <code>f</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion provides a static analysis tool to determine for each feature the set of\neffects a call to that feature may require. There is currently no syntax to\ninclude in a feature declaration the set of effects that feature requires.\nHowever, it is planned that for library code, such syntax will be added to\ndocument the effects directly required.  It is this analysis that permits the\ndetection of the safety of code.</p>\n\n<h1>Type Features</h1>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, features may have type parameters and value parameters, similar to\nJava's method that may have generic arguments and 'normal' arguments.  In\nFuzion, however, type parameters are treated much the same way as value\nparameters, but they can additionally be used as types.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to call a feature on a type argument. A simple example is the\nfollowing</p>\n\n<pre><code>f(A type, v A) is\n  say \"f called with type $A and value $v\"\n\nf u16 123\nf 123       # using type inference for A\nf 3.14\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>resulting in</p>\n\n<pre><code>f called with type u16 and value 123\nf called with type i32 and value 123\nf called with type f64 and value 3.14\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, every feature defines a type, which is the type of its local\ninstance.  Type features are features declared implicitly for every feature.\nType features duplicate the inheritance tree of their underlying features, such\nthat type features can be inherited and redefined.</p>\n\n<p>The values of type parameters are instances of these type features and the inner\nfeatures that can be called are the features defined for the type feature. We\ncan, e.g., redefine <code>asString</code> in a type feature as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>point(x, y i32) is\n\n  redef asString      =&gt; \"point $x $y\"\n  redef type.asString =&gt; \"!!!my point type!!!\"\n\nf (point 3 4)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>resulting in</p>\n\n<pre><code>f called with type !!!my point type!!! and value point 3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This mechanism is more powerful than generics as used in Java since we can\ndefine additional functionality, e.g., each type could provide an operation to\ncompare values of that type.</p>\n\n<h1>Mapping Java to Fuzion</h1>\n\n<p>The talk will present code examples of how this will be done:</p>\n\n<h2>Packages, Classes, Interfaces, instance methods</h2>\n\n<p>These are all represented by (nested) Fuzion features.</p>\n\n<h2>static methods</h2>\n\n<p>Fuzion does not have static features, every feature is declared as an inner\nfeature of some outer feature and called on an instance of that outer feature.\nHowever, type features provide a natural place for what is a static method is\nJava.  But there is more: these can be inherited and redefined!</p>\n\n<h2>Variables updates</h2>\n\n<p>In Fuzion, all fields are immutable, i.e., it is not possible to change a\nvalue. In code like</p>\n\n<pre><code>x := 123\nsay x\nx := 2*x\nsay x\nx := x+1\nsay x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>there are actually three fields <code>x</code> declared, only the later ones masks the\nearlier ones.  It is not possible to write a setter as follows</p>\n\n<pre><code>x := 123\n\nsetX(v i32) =&gt;\n  x := v\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>since this would just define a new local field <code>x</code> within the feature <code>setX</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Mutable fields must be declared explicitly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x := mut 123\nsay x\nx &lt;- 2*x\nsay x\nx &lt;- x+1\nsay x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>works. But the fact that this code performs a mutation is recorded by the\nside-effect 'mutate'.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, mutable variables are not needed, e.g., in a loop</p>\n\n<pre><code>for\n  i := 0, i + 1\nwhile i &lt; 10 do\n  say i\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>new instances of <code>i</code> are created for each loop iteration, so <code>i</code> is never\nmodified.</p>\n\n<h2>I/O operations</h2>\n\n<p>TBD: Will give an example how I/O is performed via an effect</p>\n\n<h2>Exception handling</h2>\n\n<p>A simple example using an untyped try-raise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>divide (a, b i32) =&gt;\n  if b = 0\n    try.env.raise (error \"division by zero!\")\n  a / b\n\nshow_div(a, b i32) =&gt;\n  r := try i32 (() -&gt; divide a b)\n  match r\n    v i32 =&gt; say \"ok, result is $v\"\n    e error =&gt; say \"not ok: $e)\n\nshow_div 100 12\nshow_div 100 0\nshow_div 10 100\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>static fields</h2>\n\n<p>Immutable static fields in Java are often used for constants. In Fuzion, these\ncan be just type features resulting in a constant.</p>\n\n<p>Mutable static fields, however, are used for side-effects like caching of\nintermediate results.  Fuzion effects can be used here as well,</p>\n\n<p>A cache effect does this for us:</p>\n\n<pre><code>expensive =&gt;\n  say \"sleeping 3sec...\"\n  time.nano.sleep (time.durations.seconds 3)\n  4711\n\nmy_cache(val i32) is\n\nexpensive_with_cache =&gt; (cache my_cache (() -&gt; my_cache expensive)).val\n\nsay expensive_with_cache\nsay expensive_with_cache\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Status of Fuzion</h1>\n\n<p>Fuzion is still in an early prototype stage, but the language is reaching a more\nstable state. Some of the syntax shown here is still subject to change.  We are\ndeveloping sample code to compare different options and choose a clear syntax.</p>\n\n<p>A large number of examples is shown on the Fuzion website\n<a href=\"https://flang.dev\">flang.dev</a>, in particular the\n<a href=\"https://flang.dev/tutorial\">tutorial</a>, <a href=\"https://flang.dev/idioms\">idioms</a> and\n<a href=\"https://flang.dev/design\">design</a> pages.</p>\n\n<p>Fuzion currently has two back-ends, a Java interpreter and static compiler using C\nas intermediate language.  A tool called <em>fzjava</em> creates Fuzion interfaces for\nJava modules such that interaction with arbitrary Java code is possible.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>\n\n<p>The addition of algebraic effects and powerful type parameters bring Fuzion a\nbig step ahead as a general purpose language.  The use of algebraic effects\nbrings a simple and powerful mechanism to provide many features known from\nimperative programming languages to functional world while enabling static\nanalysis to ensure that unwanted side-effects do not occur.</p>\n\n<p>With the language specification becoming more stable, it is now time to develop\na modern standard library and improve the performance of the back-ends. We are\ncurrently a small team of three developers at Tokiwa Software bringing this\nahead, but we are happy get feedback or other active contributors!</p>",

The last decade's research has shown that the abstractions and interfaces conceived decades ago have become a bottleneck, so the interplay of OS and applications needs to be revised.</p>\n\n<p>But exploring new interfaces and abstractions in an OS is a daunting and often intimidating endeavor.

It provides the flexibility and extensibility needed to accelerate OS research while also providing the drivers required to get the system running.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will show how Genode can lift the burden of creating new research operating systems. Using our research operating system as an example, we will show how easy it is to explore various OS interfaces and abstractions and how to automate experiments using Genode's scenarios. Furthermore, we will highlight the challenges we faced using Genode on multicore servers and outline what extensions to the framework we needed to implement.</p>",

      "title": "Evolution of OSv: Towards Greater Modularity and Composability",
      "abstract": "<p>By design, OSv has always been a \"fat\" unikernel and by default has provided a large subset of <code>glibc</code> functionality and has included full standard C++ library (<code>libstdc++</code>), the ZFS implementation, drivers for many devices, and has supported many hypervisors. On one hand, it makes running arbitrary applications on any hypervisor very easy using a single universal kernel. On another hand, such universality comes with the price of the bloated kernel with many symbols and drivers and possibly ZFS unused, thus causing inefficient memory usage, longer boot time, and potential security vulnerabilities. In addition, the C++ applications linked against a version of libstdc++ different than the version the kernel was linked against, may simply not work.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation, I will talk about enhancements in the new release 0.57 to address these issues. More specifically, I will focus on a new experimental build mode to hide the non-<code>glibc</code> symbols and <code>libstdc++</code> and extract ZFS code out of the kernel in form of a dynamically linked library. I will also explain another new build option to tailor the kernel to a set of specific device drivers - 'driver profiles', and another new mechanism to allow building a version of the kernel with a subset of glibc symbols needed to support a specific application.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I will also cover other interesting improvements and optimizations like \"lazy\" stack, minimal netlink support, and novel ways to build and run ZFS images.</p>",

Moreover, unikernels provide a\nnon-generic environment for applications, with limited or no support for widely\nused libraries and OS features. This issue is even more apparent in the case of\nhardware acceleration. Acceleration libraries are often dynamically linked and\nhave numerous dependencies, which directly contradict the statically linked\nnotion of unikernels. Hardware acceleration functionality is almost\nnon-existent in unikernel frameworks, mainly due to the absence of suitable\nvirtualization solutions for such devices.\nâ\nIn this talk, we present an update on the vAccel framework we have built that\ncan expose hardware acceleration semantics to workloads running on isolated\nsandboxes. We go through the components that comprise the framework and\nelaborate on the challenges in building such a software stack: we first present\nan overview of vAccel and how it works; then we focus on the porting effort of\nvAccel in various unikernel frameworks. Finally, we present a hardware\nacceleration abstraction that expose semantic acceleration functionality to\nworkloads running as unikernels.\nâ\nWe will present a short demo of some popular algorithms running on top of\nUnikraft and vAccel show-casing the merits and trade-offs of this approach.</p>",

      "title": "Loupe: Designing Application-driven Compatibility Layers in Custom Operating Systems",
      "abstract": "<p>Providing support for mainstream applications is fundamental for a new/custom\nOS to have impact in the short and long term. This is generally achieved\nthrough the development of a compatibility layer, currently an ad-hoc and\nunoptimized process that involves a vast amount of unnecessary engineering\neffort. There is a need for efficient methods to measure precisely what\nOS features are really required by a given set of target applications,\ngathering results that can help drive the development of compatibility layers\nby pinpointing what features should be implemented in priority.</p>",
      "description": "<p>In this talk I will present a streamlined methodology to optimize the\ndevelopment of the OS features required to build a compatibility layer in order\nto support a set of target applications, focusing on the system calls of the\nLinux ABI. To avoid engineering effort overestimation, we rely on dynamic\nanalysis. The methodology revolves around a tool called Loupe that measures,\nfor every system call invoked by an application processing an input workload\n(e.g. benchmark, test suite, etc.), which ones really need to be implemented\nand which ones can be faked/stubbed/partially implemented. Given a set of\napplications and input workloads, Loupe can compute for a given OS an optimized\ncompatibility layer development plan, aiming to support as many applications as\npossible, as early as possible. We analyze Loupe's measurements over a wide\n(100+) set of applications, and demonstrate in particular that the effort\nneeded to provide compatibility is significantly lower than that determined by\nprevious works using static analysis: our study shows that as much as 40-60\\%\nof system calls found in application code are not even needed to successfully\nrun meaningful workloads and even full test suites.</p>",

After all, you wouldn't say a bridge or building was successful just because the first 100 cars made it across safely. In other forms of engineering, things are load tested under demand either by weight, shocks or overload. As a software developer we should be ensuring SLAs or exploring error conditions under extreme load. But what is âloadâ in the context of software? And how do we test its many different definitions? In this talk, I will present a relationship made in heaven, the relationship between the actor model and the answer to these questions.

In this talk, I'll give an overview of the key Haskell community infrastructure and point to some opportunities for high-value contributions to the Haskell ecosystem, both for experienced Haskellers and those still learning the language. I'll also talk about how the Haskell Foundation thinks about where we can get the most leverage from our work.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>When kids learn to program they often use either a visual language like Scratch, or a textual language like Python. While visual languages are great for the first steps, children and educators often want to move on to a textual language. However early on, a textual language and its error messages can be scary and frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Hedy aims bridge this gap with a programming language that is gradual, using different language levels. In level 1, there is hardly any syntax at all; printing is done with: print hello! At every level, new syntax and concepts are added, so learners do not have to master everything at once. Hedy builds up to a subset of Python including conditions, loops, variables and lists.</p>\n\n<p>To make learning as accessible as possible, Hedy allows for the use of localized keywords, f.e in Spanish:</p>\n\n<p>imprimir Hello!</p>\n\n<p>This talk will discuss the pedagogy of Hedy as well as its technical aspects, since a set of changing and localized complex grammars poses several interesting challenges for parsing, and a small language offers a lot of potential from improved error messages.</p>",

Amazing! At this stage, what can possibly go wrong? Developers! While you are enthusiastic about Nix and wholeheartedly love it, your fellow colleagues may be quite skeptical about using a new tool they have never heard of. âMy programming language has that shiny build tool that everyone uses, why do I need to use Nix?â, âMy OS distribution has standard package manager, why should I install another one?â, âOh, no-no-no, I once installed Nix and it ate hundreds gigabytes of my disk space, I will never do it againâ â these are possible reasons why developers may be quite reluctant to using Nix. You can still go ahead and use it, but you may end up in the situation when nobody else understands and nobody wants to understand how things work, so people will request your help whenever they need to touch anything related to Nix, even if they just need to run one command on their machine. If you donât want this to happen, before introducing Nix in your codebase itâs important to tell developers what they should expect, what concerns they may have and what to do with them. In this talk, we will elaborate on some intimidating factors of Nix and possible solutions to them.</p>",

One such area was Exposure Notification: using mobile phones to detect exposure to Covid. In this talk I'll chart my experiences developing an open source implementation of the GAEN protocol, which turned into the Sailfish OS Contrac App, with equivalent functionality to Germany's Covid Warn App developed by SAP.</p>",
      "description": "<h3>Exposure Notification</h3>\n\n<p>The goal of Exposure Notification was to use mobile phones to detect potential exposure to Covid 19 carriers, and to then communicate this information to the appropriate people in a suitably privacy-respecting way.</p>\n\n<p>Different countries chose different methods for achieving this, but within Europe the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) protocol become one of the most widely used approaches. The protocol satisfied two important requirements: interoperability and privacy. The first comes from its deployment to all up-to-date Google and Apple devices everywhere in the world, offering truly global interoperability. The second from the careful and thoughtful design of the protocol itself.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk I will chart my experiences developing my own open source implementation of the GAEN protocol for use with Germany's exposure notification infrastructure. This eventually turned into the open source libcontrac library, and the Sailfish OS Contrac App, with equivalent functionality to that of the German Covid Warn App developed by SAP. Contrac gained quite widespread use within the Sailfish community.</p>\n\n<h3>Working with Other Organisations</h3>\n\n<p>Google and Apple released a specifications for the protocol very early on, and using this it was possible to release a cross-platform open-source library implementation of the protocol even before the official version rolled out to Android and iOS phones. However, this only tackled half of the problem, since the infrastructure for communication with health authorities was developed separately and independently by each country that used it, and this wouldn't be deployed until later.</p>\n\n<p>I will therefore also talk about SAP's Covid Warn App backend implementation. SAP put great effort into developing this using an open source model. On the one hand their approach was very successful and achieved its purported goals, in that it made it possible to develop a fully-independent, fully open-source, fully-functional re-implementation of the Covid Warn App for use on Linux-based mobile phones. On the other hand, my personal experience of working with the project left something to be desired. In this talk I will therefore also explore some of the traps that organisations fall into when managing large, government-level, open source projects, and in particular in relation to how they interact with small independent contributors.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be 20 minutes but have been expanded due to cancellations of other talks just before the schedule freeze.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>COVID-19 birthed a movement to use open source to address crises through rapid distributed manufacture of medical supplies and emergency equipment. However, even in drastic crises, labeling, tracking, quality assurance and authenticity is required. The Global Open Source Quality Assurance System (GOSQAS) proposes to solve this with an open provenance tracking system that will track the makerâs mark, self-asserted and 3rd-party quality tests, and changes in custody accessible with a QR code.</p>",
      "description": "<p>About a dozen nonprofits have formed an alliance to promote quality assurance for open source (free-design) devices and supplies. Open source emergency devices and medical supplies can be rapidly manufactured with distributed systems, such as hobbyists with 3D printers. This can quickly repair supply chains broken by war or natural disaster. However, the normal reputational and legal mechanisms for ensuring quality and authenticity donât function well in such crises.</p>\n\n<p>The open source solution to this is to be as transparent as possible. In the case of physical devices, this means that a would-be buyer of the device should be able to easily look up: when, where, how, and by whom it was made, what quality assurance tests have been performed on it, maintenance performed, etc. By maintaining the complete chain-of-custody, counterfeiting can be effectively mitigated.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, encryption will allow provenances to be kept appropriately private. This proposed system does not compete with other tracking systems, but can be used to complement them on a purely voluntary basis. Eventually, people will demand full and transparent provenances for many devices.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we discuss the movement, the problems, and the proposed approach.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 09.40 but have been postponed to give room for the talk Covid Exposure Notification Out in the Open to be longer to cover for cancellations of other talks just before the schedule freeze.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Digital Public Good Standard is fast approaching its two-year anniversary. The Digital Public Good Alliance (DPGA) has built a registry of Open Source solutions and tools that address the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. But how do we know whether a DPG itself is sustainable? To date, we still donât have a common way of measuring or knowing whether a DPG has what it takes to succeed and scale for different use cases. The variable for time remains unsolved in the current DPG equation.</p>\n\n<p>For folks who participate in the funding and development of DPGs, how can we build better DPGs with open and inclusive communities? Are there pitfalls to avoid or key lessons to follow? Justin &amp; Vipul will explore the life cycle of a DPG and why building in the open earlier builds better DPGs. This talk will look at DPGs and DPG nominees in different phases of development: early-stage, mid-stage, and late-stage.</p>",

Of course, we need support, help and persons, but at least it lets persons not using modern tools to contribute and, if they want, become a Debian Developer not uploading.</p>\n\n<p>Let us introduce this way and how a beginner can take stuff to get involved, and see the challenges at each of such steps.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Kaitai Struct is a tool for parsing binary formats. Binary formats, such as archive files, executables, filesystems, multimedia files, network protocols, etc. are everywhere. If your application needs to read data in a specific binary format, you need a parser that unpacks the bytes into meaningful data structures that you can work with. There are libraries doing that for popular formats, but what if there is no suitable library in your programming language for the format you need?</p>\n\n<p>Kaitai Struct has got you covered: it introduces a declarative domain-specific language (based on YAML) for describing the structure of arbitrary binary formats. Format specifications in this language are consumed by a compiler, which generates ready-to-use parsing modules in 11 programming languages (C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Nim, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby). There are more than 180 format specifications in the format gallery and hundreds more in various GitHub projects.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will discuss the current state, capabilities and limitations of Kaitai Struct. It will also focus on serialization: a highly requested feature that is being actively worked on. Currently, Kaitai Struct can only parse (read) existing binary files created by other applications. Serialization allows to edit the data of an existing file and write it back or create a new file from scratch, greatly expanding the use of all written format specifications.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Sampling CPU profilers periodically fetch the stacks of the profiled processes that are running on the CPU at a given time. Walking the stacks of native processes with a little work is easily possible when frame pointers(FPs) are present. But most binaries in the real world are not compiled with FPs. So it can get quite complicated if profilers have to walk the stacks when frame pointers are omitted. In this talk, we will talk about how we can walk the stacks using the DWARF CFI (mainly .eh_frame). We will also discuss how eBPF is helping us with that and how extending the current stack walking facilities can be useful especially in interpreted languages, such as Ruby, as well as runtimes with JITs, like the JVM.</p>",

But using an emulator to step through the original ROM code of an old computer can provide insights on how the machine worked, teaching us tricks that were usually the preserve of hardware hackers.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we cover seven different machines (including perennial home computers like the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, along with the Dragon 32, and consoles like the Gameboy) to deep dive on a single element of their implementation. We explain how data can be transfered without a data bus, why it's quicker to check for multiple results instead of one, or what is the legally optimal series of bytes for copy protection.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Beginning with a brief overview of the era in question, 1980-1985, we begin by looking at each of the 7 machines, showing an open source emulator, and how it works in a normal scenario. We then highlight a portion of the code to examine, and break down the reasons for it being written in the way it was. For each machine, we focus on the way the code makes the machine work showing a practical use to emulators that is often overlooked.</p>\n\n<p>We end with a number of \"honorary mentions\" of ROM code that exists for non-essential purposes, such as Easter eggs.</p>\n\n<p>p.s. no knowledge of antiquated assembly languages is required or expected!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Emulating a rival console released in the same year as your platform is no mean feat, nor is emulating a home console released just a few years prior as a handheld. Yet this is exactly what the PSP scene has set out to accomplish, and a few talented developers have spent hours researching these platforms in-depth and re-inventing the emulators to push them as far as possible. They have also delved into techniques never possible under official limitations - executing code directly on the second CPU, previously barred for official software, and using the latest development tools that can far exceed older results.</p>\n\n<p>How far can we really push the PSP? And can new, experimental techniques claw enough performance to emulate the impossible?</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This talk explores my recent experience of developing an emulator in Java for two of our favourite Z80-based retro machines, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Sega Master System. At first glance, Java may not seem the obvious choice for emulator development: it lacks features such as unions, macros and definable primitive types (at least until recently!) that are leveraged for efficiency by emulators written in C/C++; integrating with native libraries beyond those in the standard platform can add development complexity and performance considerations; meanwhile, our program runs in a virtual machine whose JIT compiler and garbage collector have the potential to introduce latency into time-critical code.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Java is cross-platform and includes sound, graphics, UI and concurrency APIs out of the box and its native platform integration and under-the-hood optimisations have been steadily maturing. We will explore what Java has to offer the emulator developer using âtraditionalâ Java language and standard OpenJDK features alone, and see when and how to address some of our concerns when it comes to low-level data operations and performance.</p>",

      "subtitle": "After all, why not turn your computer into a distributed system?",
      "abstract": "<p>Computational storage devices (or CSDs) are the new emerging technology that allows offloading computation to storage devices. In this technology, computation is pushed to the storage device (close to the data), and only the final result is returned to main system memory. The efficiency and performance gains come from the reduction in data movement over the I/O interconnects, thus relieving pressure on the memory bandwidth in the traditional Von Nuemann architecture where all data is first moved to the main memory before processing. Despite lots of enthusiasm, proposals, and research publications, there are no immediately available open-source ready to use CSDs available. Due to the lack of such prototypes, it is very hard and challenging to explore hardware, physical interfaces, application APIs (block-level, file system, key-value stores) for CSD devices.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I will present OpenCSD, a completely open-source CSD exploration platform designed with QEMU. OpenCSD uses eBPF as the means to offload computation to the CSD, and includes an accompanying file system. FluffleFS, the file system, uses POSIX extended attributes to interact with the CSD device. The full, open-source implementation including a block-device, programming toolchain and a file system interface; allow anyone to explore the paradigm of computational storage.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>First generation computers emerged during WW2 and developed in the 1950s and were based on quite different from the present technology: vaccum tubes/germanium diodes for processing and delay lines for memory. Running those ancestors is extremely difficult given the few examplaries left, their delicate technology and the lost expertise. However at a logical level, their architecture is not so different of our current computers as theses ancestors quickly adhered to the then emerging Von Neumann architecture. This allow us to understand their behaviour on programs through emulating their instruction set and memory structure. This talk presents this process applied by the NAM-IP computer museum to revive the memory of the GAMMA 3, the first french computer build and sold by Bull between 1952 and 1962.</p>",
      "description": "<p>After describing the machine structure and some existing emulators (assembly/javascript from ACONIT), we show how to progressively build a JAVA implementation by following the actual machine evolution from a core machine centered on an ALU operating on 7 decimal words and a 64 instruction panel to an enriched instruction set supporting a binary computation mode and external memories, including a magnetic drum of about 100KB. We then demonstrate the result on a few business programs recovered from that era. The talk also reminds about key concepts, the electromecanical context and how the transition proceeded to computers.</p>",

The change buffer is also becoming irrelevant, as the difference between random and sequential I/O is disappearing along with rotational storage (HDDs).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the rr debugger and some improvements to InnoDB data structures, we have been able to reproduce and fix several tricky bugs related to the InnoDB change buffer.</p>",

We can set breakpoints and data watchpoints and examine the state of the traced process at any point of time of execution. This even works across process boundaries, for crash recovery bugs.</p>",

The session also discusses what Vitess has to do to provide the appearance of a single monolithic MySQL even as data is sharded.

The Matrix ecosystem is well known for applications such as Instant Messaging, but what if you want to transmit real-time data such as video conferences or sensor data? matrixRTC enables this new set of applications which benefit from low delay and real-time properties.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we walk through the journey from 1:1 calling towards the powerful matrixRTC framework which powers Element Call, our video conferencing solution. We also took into account scaling and resilience in a decentralised manner. Using those base building blocks, applications such as video/audio rooms, 1:1 calls or Third Room (Matrixâ interpretation of the metaverse) are just a matter of business logic.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will start 10 minutes later than originally scheduled, and was extended by 15 minutes after the talk \"Load Testing Matrix Homeservers\" was cancelled.</p>",

This presentation will give a brief overview on how you can build a similar kind of application using the Janus WebRTC Server, by focusing on the broadcasting and scalability aspects.</p>",
      "description": "<p>While it may seem weird to think of WebRTC applications without video, that shouldn't be the case. In fact, the success of podcasts or platforms like Audible  are proof of the fact there's a lot of people definitely interested in consuming content that's only made of audio. When you think of applications like the aforementioned Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces and Reddit Talk, it's clear that the same can be said when there's potential engagement as well, and where the actual conversation becomes more important than any visual aid that may come with it.</p>\n\n<p>This made me think of how one could build a similar application using open source tools, and the Janus WebRTC Server in particular (which as a matter of fact is apparently part of the Twitter Spaces stack itself). Specifically, in the presentation I'll focus mostly on what building blocks you can start from, and how you can build a larger application on top of them in a scalable way (with or without WebRTC as a distribution channel), taking advantage of functionality Janus ships out of the box (like the RTP forwarders that were presented at FOSDEM a couple of years ago), with a few considerations on how the current audio support in WebRTC can be of help.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Reaching 500 participants was a huge ordeal because it stressed every component in our architecture, from the User Interface all the way to our XMPP server and everything in between. In order to reach 10000 participants thinking outside of the box was necessary.

      "title": "Real-time audio/video conferences in Linphone thanks to a modern SFU server",
      "abstract": "<p>Existing audio/video conferencing solutions of type âMultipoint control unitâ or âMediamixing mixerâ, have proved to be costly in terms of resources in the case of video processing, due to the algorithm complexity of video codecs. This constraint leaded to the emergence of new solutions transmitting a useful subset of the streams received from all the participants, to each participant. For example: only the video of the actively talking participant is dispatched to each participants, together with some very low resolution video streams of the other participants.\nThis technology is referred to as âSelective Forwarding Unitâ (SFU) or âSelective Forwarding Middleboxâ (SFM). These solutions open the path to conference sessions managed by a server that does not decode the media content.\nThe main benefit of a Selective Forwarding Unit is that it is capable of receiving multiple media streams and then decide which of these media streams should be sent to which participant. That way it is technically possible to enhance the number of participants to a group call.</p>\n\n<p>Linphone is likely to be the first open source SIP-based conferencing solution powered by a modern SFU server. As the server solution already used for Instant Messaging features was already compatible with open standards for the function of managing group chatrooms and their participants., the idea was to enhance this component with media capabilities. Therefore the Linphone team developed a SFU algorithm on top of mediastreamer2 and ortp (Linphoneâs media processing libraries), inside of a new software component called âMS-SFUâ.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will focus on the following topics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>compatibility of the conference establishment mechanism with SIP and the RFC 4579 (SIP Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents)</p></li>\n<li><p>stream selection performed by the SFU based on the current audio level of participants</p></li>\n<li><p>implemented standards to allow the communication between the Linphone's library and the Flexisip conference server in SFU mode</p></li>\n<li><p>how this technology paves the way for a future major innovation: end-to-end encryption for real-time audio and video conferences</p></li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Scaling Open Source Realtime Messaging System for Millions",
      "abstract": "<p>Real-time open source messaging systems are easy to design and code when small, servicing a few hundred users, and with limited media handling features. When an open source project becomes successful, however, the community of users often demand a level of scalability that the original design did not anticipate - and the entire project with its ever increasing codebase  (in both size and complexity)  can fail miserably during this transition.</p>\n\n<p>Rocket.Chat as an open source project has to cross the chasm not only once but twice in its history.   The first time we took the wisdom of the time and bolt-on a multi containerized instances approach to the monolith project.  The result is both surprising and somewhat functional - easily servicing 10s of thousands of users. Satisfying the demand at that time.</p>\n\n<p>Continued success of the project led us to the second transition into a world-scale (approaching hundreds of thousands of users)  rich messaging system.  This transition required a complete re-architecture of the monolith server - an engineering debt that we knew we had to pay before long.  The result, after two long years with a lead R&amp;D team,  is what can be described loosely as a âmicro servicesâ based scalable-by-function backend.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we will go into some technical details of these two transitions; and fill the community in on a few interesting back stories along the way.</p>",

As usual\nthe talk will cover the most recent news around the AMD support in open-source\nfirmware ecosystem and updates of the topics covered in previous years. The\ncurrent situation of coreboot project will be disclosed along with new\ndeprecations and shifting more platforms out of the main tree.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The history of AMD cooperation in coreboot projects reaches 2007 where the\nfirst contribution appeared for the Geode LX processors. AMD's open-source\nsupport continued for many years until now (with some break). Recent coreboot\nrelease enforced new requirements on the features supported by the silicon code\nbase. More aging AMD platforms kept losing interest and many of them (including\nfully open ones) starting to cause unjustifiable overhead, because of\naccumulated technical debt. And yet again we experience similar situation as\nwith the famous 4.11 branch becoming de facto stable branch for some more AMD\nplatforms (open-source AGESA family14, family15tn, family16kb). Despite the\nefforts to keep the platforms in the tree by implementing the necessary\nchanges, they landed onto the stable 4.18 branch.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays AMD is releasing the newest AGESA/FSP with the cooperation of hired\ncoreboot developers. The support covers modern mobile Ryzen chips on Chromebook\ndevices. We (3mdeb) trying to support the AMD platforms by reimplementing the\nASUS KGPE-D16 (FSF RYF platform) support in coreboot. However, the situation is\ngrowing direr as the maintainership of PC Engines platforms by 3mdeb has\nended. We would like to present Dasharo plan for long term stable and\nsustainable support for older platforms. If you are interested in open-source\nfirmware for most open x86 platforms on the market feel free to tune in and\ndiscuss the ideas with us.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h1>What is Heads</h1>\n\n<p>Heads is a secure runtime environment and a build system; a build recipe cookbook, which boards configurations instructs which modules to be incorporated in the mix needed for specific platform board configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Heads takes advantage of the linux kernel and common linux tools to create its runtime environment, including kexec, busybox, whiptail, cryptsetup, flashrom, LVM, the GPG toolstack, and other important and already existing tools to empower its runtime environement.</p>\n\n<p>The typical output of a build are a packed initramfs and kernel, included inside a coreboot ROM image as its payload. Depending on the architecture/chipsets of a platform, it also integrates neutered/deactivated Intel ME/CSME binary blob (platform dependent), generated Gigabit Ethernet (GBE) configuration blob and an unlocked descriptor (IFD). The produced firmware images requires the platform to be flashed once externally to overwrite the origin flash chip(s) content, more specifically to overwrite locked IFD and ME/MCSE regions and to maximize the BIOS region to the extent of liberated Intel ME firmware region. Heads firmware upgrades can then happen internally for the lifetime of the platform.</p>\n\n<h1>Why Heads</h1>\n\n<p>Heads take advantage of coreboot measured boot in Static Root of Trust (SRTM) mode as a measurement base, which currently measures itself as early as possible, normally from bootblock(or romstage) into TPM a singleregister (PCR2). Heads payload is then executed after measured and extends TPM with its own measurements in distinct PCRs in the goal of sealing secrets in TPM's distinct NV regions. Kernel modules are measured prior to being loaded, LUKS drive(s) headers are measured if a TPM disk encryption key is configured, while going to the Recovery shell invalidates the TPM measurements by the same TPM extend mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>From a user standpoint, those sealed secrets enables oneself to validate the integrity of the firmware either through TOTP code shown on screen on its smartphone or through HOTP (which challenges validity against supported enabled HOTP USB Security dongles). Another TPM sealed secret enables the user to release an additional LUKS disk encryption key only if the firmware is intact, that kernel modules loaded and Headers are consistent to sealed state and only if provided passphrase matches. Heads also validates user detached signed /boot digests against its fused in rom public key, which guarantees both integrity and authenticity of the trusted boot configuration prior of kexecâing into it.</p>\n\n<p>A lot happened since 2020...

      "description": "<p>Semihosting has long been used to provide host services for embedded ARM systems, especially microcontrollers. However, its use on Linux-capable systems has been much patchier. Vendor-supported recovery modes often use JTAG, but seldom make use of the features provided by semihosting. U-Boot has supported loading files using semihosting on ARM Virtual Express platforms since 2014, but lacked serial support and integration with standard commands. In release 2022.07, such support has been added, motivated by use on QorIQ platforms.</p>\n\n<p>NXP QorIQ platforms require a valid configuration programmed into the boot source in order to boot. Although there is a fallback configuration, it does not support traditional firmware loading interfaces such as USB or Ethernet. By using U-Boot semihosted over JTAG with OpenOCD, a recovery image can be loaded which is sufficient to complete device programming. The same binaries can be used to boot from eMMC as well as JTAG, simplifying configuration. Because semihosting is standard across ARM platforms which support JTAG debugging, similar strategies can be reused whenever JTAG is the most convenient communication method.</p>\n\n<p>The target audience of this talk includes users of ARM or RISC-V platforms with JTAG Boot; users of U-Boot, OpenOCD, and QEMU; and developers of other bootloaders who are interested in adding semihosting support.</p>",

This provides some interesting bootstrap issues, especially for newer architectures, as we need to recreate the bootstrap path as it may have existed years ago in order to support programming languages. Some languages, like nodejs or ocaml, need to have support backported only a few versions. Others like java need more than a decade.

      "abstract": "<p>The Open Hardware Group (https://www.openhwgroup.org/) is a large industry/academic consortium developing a family of fully open source, commercial grade RISC-V cores, branded as CORE-V. These are supported by a full software ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk we will look at the challenges of developing a vendor specific software ecosystem, how this ecosystem relates to the official upstream projects, and particularly the technical challenges in developing, maintaining and upstreaming vendor specific software.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Although CORE-V is a completely standard RISC-V architecture, it supports a large number of custom ISA extensions, and it is the support of these extensions that creates most of the challenge.  Many of these extensions come from the PULP research group at ETH ZÃ¼rich, but some are pre-freeze versions of what will become standard RISC-V extensions.</p>\n\n<p>The upstream projects generally provide mechanisms to support vendor specific variants, for example by use of the vendor field in the target triplet.  Thus rather than the generic riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc compiler, we can have the riscv32-corev-elf-gcc compiler. However this requires modifications to the code to use this information to control when CORE-V specific functionality is to be enabled, and this talk will explore these. In one specific case (vendor specific relocations), we are waiting on standardization from the RISC-V psabi committee, but otherwise this is all using well proven existing technology.</p>\n\n<p>The work has also served to expose gaps in the upstream projects. For example, while versioning of ISA extensions is standardized, the code base for the GNU assembler lacks the infrastructure to handle this.  Similarly many ISA extensions require builtin (intrinsic) function support, but the upstream tools have only a handful of builtin functions, and the infrastructure for RISC-V builtins is very small.</p>\n\n<p>The talk cannot cover detail of every tool and operating system being developed, so will concentrate particularly on the CORE-V GCC tool chain.  However we will draw parallels with the work going on in CORE-V specific simulators and in CORE-V specific operating systems.</p>",

Encrypting data at rest (e.g. files, objects, storage) and in transit (e.g. TLS, HTTPS) have become a common practice, while encrypting data in use (the core idea behind Confidential Computing) is still an emerging concern.</p>\n\n<p>But while a common practice today, encrypting data in transit only gained wide adoption with the Letâs Encrypt movement, which was fundamental in changing the general mindset from âencryption is only important for e-commerce and banking applicationsâ to âletâs encrypt everything by default, no matter whatâs the applicationâ. Confidential Computing is just starting to emerge, and most use cases are restricted to sectors like healthcare and banking, which require greater assurances that their sensitive code and data are protected.</p>\n\n<p>We will look back at the Let's Encrypt project, which started 10 years, to understand why this movement was so successful and how we can replicate this success for encrypting data in use. Our hope is to make encrypting data in use the default way for deploying applications, which will fundamentally change the security approach that exists today.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Distributed datastores such as etcd are widespread, particularly in the world of orchestration. They support the core of services like Kubernetes, providing storage for and access to critical data. These orchestration platforms are being increasingly run in the cloud but the core datastores donât support natively running in confidential environments, despite the critical data they store. The âlift-and-shiftâ approach leaves changes to be made to fully leverage the confidential computing context, making it unsuitable. On the other hand, native confidential applications can be difficult to build from scratch, hence the development of frameworks such as CCF which provide small-TCB building blocks for distributed services. LSKV, the Ledger-backed Secure Key-Value store, is built on top of CCF and provides a familiar etcd API, being able to seamlessly slot into existing systems. It keeps cloud operators out of the trust boundary and makes governance operations publicly available to audit on a ledger.Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­ LSKV aims to democratise confidential computing, lowering the barrier to entry and making it available to the masses.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Kubernetes has been transformative not onlyfrom the technical point of view, but also by introducing processes that democratized dealing with infrascture to some degree. To Enable developers to deploy their workloads independently required segmenting responsibilities of operating and using the cluster. The personas of Cluster Admin and API Users (and various shades in this spectrum) have been introduced to ensure teams can collaborate in a shared compute environment in safe and reliable manner. A multitude of extensions, tooling and processes have been introduced to protect a Kubernetes environment from malicious or erronous workloads (supply chain security).</p>\n\n<p>However, typically this model is still very much hierarchical: Cloud Service Providers (CSP) serve compute and control plane components which are then administered By Cluster Operators (CO) who configure the security and compliance boundaries in which Users can operate. Confidential Computing is challenging this model. The notion of rusted execution environments and trusted parties, which may exclude the CO and most likely the CSP turns a rigid pyramid of privileges into a more messy, bi-directional picture. We want to discuss some of the conceptual and technical challenges that we currently identifiy for Confidential Computing in a Cloud Native environment and review ongoing, practical efforts to reconcile both domains.</p>",

External networking and storage are not available by default inside an enclave. The only way an enclave can communicate with the outside world is through a vsock connection to the parent VM. Salmiac provides network access to the applications inside an enclave by proxying network packages over this vsock connection. Offering secure persistent storage to nitro enclaves is more challenging. Salmiac saves the state of the application in a network block device. Data is transferred into the device via the vsock network channel that connects the enclave and parent in a nitro instance. It is secured by utilizing the Linux kernel's Device Mapper features like dm-verity and dm-crypt.</p>",

Applying the Confidential Computing concept to entire Kubernetes clusters ensures always-encrypted data and eliminates the service provider's access but also contradicts the managed approach. Fully isolated and self-managed clusters provide maximum control and privacy but do not offer smart features out of the box. This results in a tradeoff between ease of use and security. We present a Kubernetes-native approach, allowing a cluster to manage itself while offering many features known from fully managed alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>The solution comes in the form of open-source microservices that provide secure and autonomous joining of new nodes, autoscaling, failsafe node OS updates, and even Kubernetes upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>The talk covers microservice design patterns that give control back to the Kubernetes administrator.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we explain how remote attestation can help our system to verify each software component of a Kubernetes node during the bootstrapping process, adding that extra level of security to an autonomous architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we explain how you can securely automate the Kubernetes node lifecycle: How nodes can prove their integrity and can join Kubernetes clusters autonomously without relying on a trusted third party to mediate the process.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Scaling a modern CI workflow to a large distribution",
      "abstract": "<p>Spack is a software distribution targeted at HPC systems, with over 6,800 packages.  While Spack has long been a source-only distribution, in June 2022 we added public build caches that offer fixed and rolling binary releases. With 400-500 pull requests per month, most of them package updates, this was a non-trivial task. The build cache model for Spack is similar to Nix and  Guix â it assumes no ABI compatibility. Any change to dependencies triggers rebuilds of dependents. Despite these challenges we have been able to build a CI system that builds and tests packages on pull request and on release branches for a subset of several thousand builds for x86_64, Power, and aarch64, as well as for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and Intel's oneapi compiler.  This talk will cover some of the main challenges we have faced: reliable build infrastructure, integration with pull request workflows, Kubernetes auto-scaling and AWS instance selection, and optimizing build performance in the cloud.  Weâll talk about the infrastructure, as well as the algorithmic complexities of choosing CI commits carefully to minimize builds.</p>",
      "description": "<p>This talk is targeted at distribution maintainers, particularly people managing build farms for large distributions.  The goal of the presentation is to highlight the challenges of managing a rolling release for continuously evolving distributions hosted on GitHub.</p>\n\n<p>Spack manages 400-500 pull requests/month and is a very active repository.  Keeping all the builds working all the time, particularly in a build-from-source system where the recipes are templated, is a big challenge.  We may have the same package built many different ways in Spack (e.g. for different CPUs, GPUs, or MPI implementations), and all of those are managed by the same recipe and a very smart dependency/package configuration resolver.</p>\n\n<p>The talk will cover how weâve scaled build caching to manage PRs as well as release branches, and how weâve set up infrastructure that allows us to request builders with specific processor microarchitectures.  The CI system is orchestrated by a high availability GitLab CI instance in the cloud. Builds are automated and triggered by pull requests, with runners both in the cloud and on bare metal.  We will talk about the architecture of the CI system, from the user-facing stack descriptions in YAML to backend services like Kubernetes, Karpenter, S3, CloudFront, and the challenges of tuning runners to give good build performance.</p>\n\n<p>We'll also cover a bit about security in a completely PR-driven CI system.  Specifically, we cover how we guarantee that arbitrary public CI users canât inject malicious code into our binaries.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing commits to build from the distribution tree has been a challenge as well, and in a build-cached system, choosing the right commit to <em>merge</em> a PR with can be a key factor in minimizing the number of builds that need to be done.  Specifically, we are trying to maximize <em>reuse</em> of builds done on the rolling release branch while still allowing PRs to update frequently.  Orchestrating this in CI, particularly when most systems want to merge with the head of the mainline, can be a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we'll talk about some of the architectural decisions in Spack itself that had to change to better support CI â specifically with the dependency resolver and how we choose exactly which stack configurations to build in CI for the rolling release.</p>\n\n<p>All of this topics should help distribution managers better orchestrate build farms, and they should be particularly relevant to other distributions that are similar to Spack, like Nix and Guix.</p>",

Most people think of our efforts around packaging, integrating new technologies in our distros, and building communities around what we do. But how our communities innovate goes beyond technology alone. There is also innovation around diversity and inclusion in our communities. For women, Linux distro communities can provide a place to learn about open source, start building a career, and growing their professional networks. The goal of this session is to call out womenâs contributions in this space, highlight ongoing progress to make Linux communities more inclusive, and a wish list of things our communities could improve so the diversity of our community increases.</p>\n\n<p>The future's looking bright for women who aspire to leave their mark in the world of Open Source. Letâs look at their contributions in distributions and FOSS spaces as we move at light speed from on-prem to cloud to edge computing.</p>",

The people designing 32-bit linux products/systems still likely to be in use then have long product cycles so fixing this has become quite urgent.

This session intends to get feedback on the problem and help inform a plan.</p>",
      "description": "<p>The fundamental choice is whether to treat it is a new arch/ABI/triplet or to migrate within the existing 32-bit arches/triplets to the new ABI. If different distros take different paths here we could end up in very confusing place. Updating ABIs has happened before so it is possible, but time_t appears in a lot of places and such a migration is certainly tricky. It may not be practical for some binary distros. Rebuilding from scratch is simpler but definitely requires a new GNU triplet.</p>\n\n<p>Various people have looked into this over the last 3 years, but no one person has a good overview. Exactly how difficult this transition is still needs some experimentation and research. FOSDEM is a good opportunity to see where we are at, and see if we are agreed on a way forward.</p>",

We recruit qualified students from our class to internship programs within Red Hat, and we promote the best interns to hiring managers with the aim of bringing them into the industry as full time software engineers. We have pulled together this program from scratch over the past few years, iterating our program and curriculum design in order to stand the program on its feet. As an established program, we plan to continue to scale our program and strengthen our partnerships, including a recent one with the Linux Foundation, in order to bring Linux kernel and low-level software engineering education to a larger audience and global talent pool.</p>",

As young, novice software engineers, we noticed this problem, and we quickly became aware that we were far from the only ones to do so. Engineers and managers of all levels within our industry niche have observed -- both privately and publicly -- that we must bring new talent into these spaces, and we must do so urgently. We have seen firsthand among the many talented and experienced engineers firsthand and we have benefited greatly from their guidance and mentorship, but we know that this opportunity will not last forever. Time spares no one, not even the engineers from the days of Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>We have come to understand the invaluable and non-quantifiable nature of the tribal knowledge that exists distributed among the great engineers of our industry, and we believe that we must act quickly to enable them to pass on the torch, to strengthen the next link of the great chain of our relatively young but quickly maturing industry.</p>\n\n<p>With this understanding, we have created the Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a program to bridge the gaps between academia and industry, between the novice and the legend, between the past and the future.</p>",

      "description": "<p>With widespread use of containers and Kubernetes, there are fewer requirements for operating systems. In addition, traditional operating systems maybe bring various problems like security, O&amp;M overhead, and OS version splitting problems. This talk will discuss the current problems faced by OS management and upgrade and the concept of Container operating system. Then, share the design ideas and solutions of the container operating system KubeOS. Finally, introduce the architecture, functions, and use of KubeOS in detail.\nThis talk is likely to be interesting to the O&amp;M personnel, the system administrator, or anyone interested in how the OS of a cluster node becomes a cluster component.</p>\n\n<p>This talk was amended on 3 February 2023 to swap the speakers, as the original speaker was unable to attend FOSDEM due to visa issues.</p>",

Due to the latest innovations with eBPF, AF_XDP and Cloud Native Data Plane (CNDP), there is a unique opportunity to develop a hybrid networking stack that leverages the best of both worlds (kernel smarts and user space performance). As such, developers no longer need to pick one attribute over the other. This Demo will showcase a CNDP-FRR vRouter an example of a hybrid network stack!</p>",

The development of MPTCP in the Linux kernel is particular and has not been directly available on a vanilla kernel. Indeed, after 10 years of experimentations on the side -- in an Open-Source \"out-of-tree\" kernel -- the implementation has been rewritten (almost) from scratch to get an \"upstreamable\" result that is still being improved today. On the other hand, the out-of-tree kernel was and is still used today in production on large deployments with million of users. Maintaining this out of tree kernel with more than 21k modified lines for each different LTS version has a cost and also introduce some risks and complex situations that are interesting to share.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Devres is a simple resource management system commonly used in linux device drivers. It's based on creating a linked list of various resources associated with given device. Managed resources can be acquired during the life-time of a device (typically when the device is probed after being bound to a driver) and will get released when the driver is detached from the device - be it on .probe() error or after .remove() returns.</p>\n\n<p>On multiple occasions, devres has been blamed for use-after-free bugs that can be triggered from user-space in several subsystems. A simple way to trigger those bugs in vulnerable subsystems is to: open a device file, unbind the driver from the device and call any of the system calls relevant for this device.</p>\n\n<p>While those bugs do exist, I believe devres has nothing to do with them, rather they are caused by managing resources with devres that should survive the driver unbind and instead live for as long as the underlying struct device's reference count does not drop down to 0. This talk will present detailed explanation and examples.</p>\n\n<p>Devres is actually an easy way to simplify error paths and REDUCE resource leaks and memory bugs. There is only a limited number of use-cases where devres must not be used and for most cases it can be hidden behind the subsystem's APIs. The aversion to devres that certain maintainers express is unjustified and this talk aims at changing people's minds.</p>",

      "description": "<p>We know that an API gateway offers a central control point for incoming traffic to a variety of destinations but it can also be a central point for observation as well since it is uniquely qualified to know about all the traffic moving between clients and our service networks. Instead of spending time integrating your services with other many tools and technologies to improve observability, you can easily manage all work with Apache APISIX Plugins.</p>\n\n<p>The core of observability breaks down into three key areas: structured logs, metrics, and traces. In this talk, we will walk through each pillar of API observability and we will learn how with Apache APISIX Plugins we can simplify these tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Most observability platforms like (Prometheus, Skywalking, Opentelemetry, etc.) provide pre-built connectors and we will describe how you can easily integrate your API log data further derive useful metrics, and gain complete visibility into the usage, performance, and security of your APIs in your environment.</p>",

As coverage increases in the project pipelines, the impact of any unreliability or failure in the hardware pool multiplies. Continuous monitoring and recovery mechanisms are crucial to ensure good device availability and reliability.</p>\n\n<p>We will discuss the lifecycle of devices inside the lab from the bring-up to the day-to-day care, as well as the ongoing efforts to make the Collabora LAVA lab more robust as it grows.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Who said using QUIC was easy?",
      "abstract": "<p>For years, the majority of internet applications have used either TCP or UDP as the transport layer protocol of choice. Recently, a new contestant - QUIC, an end-to-end encrypted protocol - has entered the ring. QUIC is being marketed as the successor to TCP and tackles some of its inherent problems. An excellent example is the Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking issue perceived by, for example, web pages. While QUIC holds many advantages over its predecessor, it still suffers from interoperability challenges and holds a number of open questions. The biggest one is: how do we efficiently test, measure, and debug the performance of applications using QUIC?</p>\n\n<p>Answering the above question is non-trivial and plays a significant part in my research as a Ph.D. candidate. In this talk, we will â from a beginner's perspective â discuss why getting started with optimizing applications using QUIC as a protocol might seem daunting. We will discuss some tools available such as qlog, and why they can be more insightful than solely relying on packet traces. Finally, we will demonstrate our in-house developed automation framework called Vegvisir. Initially designed for analyzing the performance of video streaming over QUIC, it is now generalized for end-to-end testing of any networked applications. The goal of Vegvisir is to help alleviate some of the obstacles mentioned earlier, but also to ensure that developers and researchers can perform tests with QUIC consistently and reliably.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In 2016 a group of innovators from healthcare, mental healthcare, social work and design teamed up to create a roadmap to a future-proof (health)care system. An important part of this healthcare system is an open source ecosystem of digital health applications that can cooperate in an integrated way. Right from the start, privacy has been an important part of the project: agency is at the core of the innovation project and agency is among the central values within privacy. So one of the central questions of the project was: âHow to translate the principle of agency into design choices for data privacy within an ecosystem of digital health applications.â We will tell how this question was answered by looking back at the process and at the choices made about the user interaction and technology.</p>",
      "description": "<p>During this project we were confronted with three separate perspectives on privacy: a theoretical perspective that is generally focused on the philosophical meaning of privacy, secondly, a technological perspective driven by the suppliers of digital products and lastly a user interaction perspective, driven by the end userâs experience of privacy. The conflicting perspectives were holding back the progress of the project. Therefore we had to find a way to mediate between these separate perspectives. An important part of this mediation process was finding common values and translating these to overarching principles that are comprehensible to the different perspectives and stakeholders. Next these newfound principles were validated with end-users, representing the interaction perspective. For this purpose we used gamification and mock-ups to make the more abstract principles tangible and testable. Finally the general principles were translated to clear design guidelines for the technological perspective. This presentation will show how we combined a theoretical view on privacy with the users perspective and how we translated these into guidelines for user interaction and into a technical architecture. And you will leave with some practical tips when conducting comparable projects!</p>",

      "subtitle": "Helping your users help you",
      "abstract": "<p>Many small to medium-sized open source projects depend on user donations for their primary source of funding.  Proper design of the funding webpage can have an outsized impact on whether your projects' end users decide to support your project financially.  Additionally, projects can easily pitch the funding ask too strenuously or not enough, leading to end user alienation and disengagement.</p>\n\n<p>Learn how to design an effective funding webpage that helps to grow your community and supports the long term viability of your project.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Talking about donations is slightly taboo in the FLOSS world.  But the biggest secret is that people who donate money are one of your projects' largest assets because their contribution links them tightly to your project's community (coders, writers, artists, translators, end-users and other people who donate).  By running an effective donation program, you are growing your community and strengthening the long term resilience of your project.</p>\n\n<p>Even if your project doesn't need the funding directly, building a funding program will build your project in other ways.  Funding contributed to your project is ideally contributed upstream to your supporting libraries.  This process links multiple members with open source contributions that they were not even aware were helping them.  And this process starts with effective design.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will cover</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing the design consumer</li>\n<li>Where to place the donation page</li>\n<li>How to optimize the page for both engagement and ease of use</li>\n<li>Easy A/B testing without extra setup</li>\n<li>Building effective community with your donation page.</li>\n<li>Big red flags to avoid</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Additionally, this talk will give specific, concrete examples and results from the design process of the KiCad EDA suite's donation program.</p>",

      "title": "Understanding and Managing the Dependency in SBOM with the New Feature of SW360",
      "abstract": "<p>In recent years, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has emerged as an important practice to manage the risks in the software supply chain. To achieve this goal, understanding and managing the dependency is an indispensable task when applying the SBOM. In SW360 - a software component catalog application, we proposed features to manage SBOM in Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) format last year (https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/how<em>to</em>manage<em>oss</em>license<em>obligation</em>and<em>sbom</em>using<em>sw360</em>new_features/). But because of the limitation of the old features, dependency management is still an urgent problem to be solved. The projects registered in SW360 can only create their dependency graphs by searching the components registered in SW360 dynamically. However, to apply SBOM, it's necessary to enable projects to store dependency graphs for themselves. Therefore, Adding the dependency management function for projects registered in SW360 is important for importing and managing SBOM information such as SPDX information in SW360. This function will also help in managing vulnerabilities of projects registered in SW360. To achieve this goal, TOSHIBA proposed and developed a series of features in SW360 to help users in managing the dependencies of their projects more conveniently. With these user-friendly features, users could register, view and modify the dependency graphs of their projects flexibly. Combined with the existing SBOM management function in SW360, the new features will help users to use SBOM in practice more easily. These features will also help SW360 to collaborate with other tools and explore more possibilities for managing vulnerabilities. In this presentation, I will first explain the issues related to dependency management in SW360. Then I would like to introduce and demonstrate these new features of SW360 developed by TOSHIBA. These features may include some that are still under development.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Developing, using, and re-using Free Software is fun, but declaring licensing and copyright information is not. REUSE changes that. With three simple steps, it makes declaring licensing and copyright information unambiguous and perfectly human- and machine-readable, making life easier for everyone involved in the software supply chain. In this presentation, we will present the latest learnings from big projects that recently became REUSE-compliant. In addition, we will provide you with an update on the latest features of the REUSE CLI tool.</p>",
      "description": "<p>As software has gotten more complex over the last years, the importance of declaring licensing information has become even more crucial. The FSFE's REUSE initiative contributes to the goal of clearly displaying legal information in Free Software projects by embedding it into every file of the repository. Any project following the REUSE recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable for both humans and machines. We ensure that individuals, organisations, and companies that are reusing code are aware of and respect the licence terms chosen by its original author, thus facilitating the communication of this legal information among everyone involved in the software supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>REUSE integrates seamlessly into development processes and other best practices of indicating Free Software licences. In addition, there are tools and documentation to help you get started. During this talk, we will take you through the learnings of large projects becoming REUSE compliant (e.g. curl or GNUHealth) and present the latest features of our REUSE helper tool, which makes declaring license information a quick and fun endeavour.</p>",

We worked on some complements that need to be added to consume it for all bells and whistles of a full OpenChain conformant software composition analysis. We have created a way to preserve this information throughout the entire process of creating a build and can demonstrate how it is possible to uniquely identify each and every file that goes into the final image, resolve each binary file license from a large mix of diversely licensed source files, find the dependencies, find potential incompatibilities and <em>reuse</em> this information by sharing it publicly. This for a project whose base of data and number of vetted licenses,files and packages is very large (one would say \"huge\"). Therefore, what we regard as an unprecedented amount of automation had to be put to work.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In the world of manufacturing, a bill of materials (BOM) constitutes a quantified list of raw materials and components used to produce, for instance, a given refrigerator. The equivalent in the software world would be a list of all third-party libraries needed to compile, test, and release a software product. There is, however, a significant difference between the BOM for a refrigerator and a software product. Unlike for refrigerators, not all software products' ingredients (i.e., third-party libraries) are actually used!</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we will present findings from our recent academic research comparing SBOMs generated from different sources of abstraction (i.e., manifest data and call graph data) to highlight that potential inaccuracy can hamper the actionability of SBOMs. Evaluating the severity of security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries is one such example. Moreover, we will also demonstrate from a recent experiment that available tools generate different SBOMs for the same software product, showcasing that SBOMs are not trivial to standardize. Finally, we will wrap up the talk with a discussion on challenges and opportunities to establish a ground truth for SBOMs.</p>",

In many companies, the community or DevRel teams are small, impossibly small for the work that needs to be done.  If you are like most companies I have talked to, your job in one of these roles is to gain lots and lots of adoption, âGrow the user base,â your boss will tell you.  The issue is how does a team of 1 or a handful of people build and support tens of thousands or even potentially millions of usersâ¦ the answer is you donât.  Rather the goal of most teams should be to support and grow external advocates and evangelists who can do the work for you.  Hiring 2 people to tell the world how awesome your software is can only reach so farâ¦ but if those 2 people get 1000 people to tell their story that has a massive reach.  So how do you build such a system?  How do you measure it?  I will walk through what I have learned when talking to hundreds of community teams over the last 5 years and share with you what I have seen works and what does not.</p>",

Over half (59%) have quit or considered quitting maintaining a project, and almost half of respondents listed lack of financial compensation as their top reason for disliking being a maintainer.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the projects maintained by the proverbial single individual in Nebraska in their free time narrative, there are other reasons for projects \"going bad\". I'd like to share some stories, straight from the horse's mouth, share some of the give-aways of unhealthy projects, and together find ways for mitigation.</p>",

What if we could create clear links between standards and code? This would  make our open source and  standards communities more productive. It would also make the great work they do more useful and rewarding.

Dedicated enthusiasts all over Europe help spreading the idea of software freedom and anchoring the call for public code on all levels.</p>\n\n<p>More than 200 organisations, and tens of thousands of individuals already signed the âPublic Money? Public Code!â open letter, demanding that publicly financed software should be made publicly available under Free Software licenses. Together we contacted politicians, decision makers, and civil servants on all levels -- from the European Union and national governments, to city mayors and the heads of public libraries about this demand. This did not just lead to important discussions about software freedom with decision makers, but also already to specific policy changes. Already, we have administrations from Spain, Sweden and Germany supporting âPublic Money? Public Code!â.</p>",

      "title": "Contributor Growth Strategies for OSS Projects",
      "abstract": "<p>Many projects struggle to find people who will actively participate in their projects and continue to participate over the long term. We are in a situation now where there are a lot of open source projects and not enough contributors. Maintainers are burning out and in desperate need for help. This session will provide practical advice and suggestions for ways to encourage participation while avoiding some common barriers that prevent people from contributing.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Maintaining an open source project is hard work that often extends out over several years, and maintainer burnout is common within open source projects. It can be hard for already overworked maintainers to balance the day to day work required to keep the project running while also investing in additional activity to increase future community sustainability. This includes getting help with all of the different types of contributions required to make an open source project successful: documentation, marketing, community management, and so much more. The good news is that we have best practices, resources, guides, and templates available to make it easier for maintainers and projects to build a contributor strategy that leads to a strong and growing community for an open source project over the long term. This talk will help you apply those resources in your project.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will have several major sections. 1) Discussion about the major factors that impact contributor growth. 2) Developing and executing on a long-term contributor growth strategy, including governance, new contributor onboarding, and mentoring. 3) Using contributor ladders to promote contributors into leadership positions as more maintainers to share the workload can reduce maintainer burnout over time. 4) Metrics for measuring project sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>The audience will walk away with a better understanding of how to grow their contributor base and build a community around their open source project.</p>",

      "title": "Centering DEI Within Your Open Source Project",
      "abstract": "<p>The CHAOSS project represents a potential force for power and good in open source. This session includes speakers who took part in a two-year long reflection on DEI practices within the CHAOSS project. The session will help other open source projects in their work towards improving diversity, equity, and inclusion by exploring practices within the CHAOSS project first, then using those examples as points of reference for other projects. Our efforts have focused us on newcomer experiences, community surveys, and sustaining the people within the project. In particular, the session will discuss these efforts, aimed at answering the question of: How do we help open source communities to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive?</p>",
      "description": "<p>Intro: Our CHAOSS DEI reflection team is amazing. We have been able to work together over the last few years, building and establishing direction for the CHAOSS project and others. Our work has resulted in many improvements within the CHAOSS project as well as external engagements aimed at better centering DEI within open source.</p>\n\n<p>Main idea 1: Supporting new contributors and making your onboarding process smooth helps with contributor retention.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Supporting detail 1: Challenges include language barriers, time zones, access to tools from bandwidth limitations or other access limitations, merging in and accepting contributions in a timely manner</p></li>\n<li><p>Supporting detail 2: Helpful strategies include improving documentation, open office hours, welcome slackbot, accepting contributions of all kinds, having a newcomer space in slack/communication channels, onboarding calls</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Main idea 2: Our two-year reflection process did not always go as planned.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supporting detail 1: Building newcomer experiences has been challenging. The CHAOSS global community has grown tremendously, for example, the African chapter has grown to over 180 members in the last few monthsâ and as such, newcomer onboarding and paths to contribution became a priority for us. Our expectation was to make a difference and directly assist newcomers in CHAOSS since many of us  can relate to their pain of getting overwhelmed by the many parts in CHAOSS. It is  true that we made a significant impact; however, we had to reevaluate our first plan and improve on it. For example, office hours didn't get as much attention as we would have liked, so we adjusted the time and cadence, then went one step further with documentation diversity for newcomers (specifically the teams' sheet and quickstart for newcomers). More recently, we started a strategy document for newcomers' onboarding and have kickstarted newcomer onboarding calls.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Main idea 3: Strategic use of community surveys helps you to better understand the feelings, emotion, and qualitative feedback of the community.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supporting detail 1: Make sure the community survey is completely anonymous and no personal information will be collected, and is GDPR compliant. Access to data should be limited and only report aggregated data on a high level. Have clear goals for what you want to learn more about, but be open to organic community response. Also consider troll-ish responses, and follow set standards when asking about demographic data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Conclusion: We have learned to be patient with our work. Advancing DEI in open source is challenging as we attend to corporate interests, community needs, and, most importantly, the safety of people for whom our efforts have an impact.</p>",

Even as our lives are returning to normal and people are returning to in-person events, I believe there will continue to be a place for virtual events as the virtual format offers some important advantages.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, Ray will discuss some of the advantages of virtual events, such as smaller resource requirements, simpler logistics, easier distribution of content, and opportunities for experimentation. In addition, virtual events do not need to be limited to tutorial-type sessions, but they can also be used to provide additional opportunities for community members to get together, network, and collaborate (e.g., for triaging issues, working on documentation, etc.). Even as life returns to normal, virtual events should remain an important toolâand complement what weâre doing with in-person eventsâfor helping open-source communities grow.</p>\n\n<p>Ray will also discuss some of the common mistakes and challenges in virtual events, such as limited opportunities for casual interactions, difficulty facilitating hands-on work, time zone challenges, etc., and how we can work together to mitigate these issues.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Where TypeScript is helpless, JavaScript Proxies come to the rescue!",
      "abstract": "<p>JavaScript developers learned to love TypeScript after seeing the benefits of static type-checking. But there is still a lot of data that that TypeScript is not able to check, because it is only known at runtime: JSON responses from an API, user inputs in a form, content taken from client-side local storages, browsers API quirks... In that case, you can only assume the types and pray for the best, or manually code tedious specific type checks. I'd like to introduce you to ObjectModel, an open source library I created with the intent to bring automatic strong dynamic type-checking to JavaScript projects. By leveraging ES6 Proxies, this library ensures that your variables always match the model definition and validation constraints you added to them. Thanks to the generated exceptions, it will help you spot potential bugs and save you time spent on debugging. I will also discuss the many other benefits of validating types at runtime, because as you will see, it leads to more than just type checking.</p>",
      "description": "<p>I will present a few scenarios where TypeScript is helpless to detect type errors. Then I will discuss about ES6 Proxies, and how you can make type-safe objects in JavaScript itself. Finally I will present ObjectModel, a mature, well tested open source library that has ~2500 weekly downloads on NPM. ObjectModel is very easy to master: no new language to learn, no new tools, no compilation step, just a minimalist and intuitive API in a plain old JS micro-library. The audience should be able to immediately understand the interest of this library regarding the type assertions, but as a conclusion I will show how ObjectModel can also be used for other usecases such as form validation or API unit testing.</p>",

What should the lifecycle of plugins be? How can developers test and distribute plugins?</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation we will share the issues and questions we faced when developing a plugin system for Headlamp, a Kubernetes UI project, and how we addressed them.</p>",
      "description": "<p>UIs and their effectiveness can be very subjective. What works for some users will very likely not please many others.</p>\n\n<p>In Open Source, a full adaptation of a project to one's needs can be achieved by forking and modifying a project but that often results a massive effort to keep the fork or downstream changes close to upstream.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative to maintaining a fork can be a comprehensive plugin system. Such systems allow a projectâs functionality to be extended via code that's dynamically loaded. Such extensions or plugins allow developers to isolate their changes and focus on them, thus avoiding having to fork and modifying the original project (or keeping changes to a minimum), and it becomes the base project maintainers' responsibility to keep the plugins working.</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript is a very flexible language to accomplish such extensions in a project by dynamically loading code, and React allows to reuse components in an isolated way, but developing a plugins system comes with many decisions and implications: What should we allow to be extended (and how)? When should we load plugins? What if they fail to load? What about the lifetime of pluginsâ React components? How to avoid bundling modules that will be available in the base project when plugins are loaded? How should end users run the plugins? How can they test the plugins?</p>\n\n<p>We had to figure out all these questions when developing Headlamp, a Kubernetes UI that can be run as a web or desktop app and was created to offer a generic UI in its core but allowing users to modify and brand it through plugins, instead of having to maintain a fork of it.</p>\n\n<p>In this presentation we will share how we addressed the questions around creating a plugin system: how we used webpackâs external modules to avoid bundling core modules, how we first shipped only type definitions of the libraries plugins use (and later decided we needed to ship the source code itself), how we created a helper script to bootstrap and keep updates under control, and many other considerations. Hopefully this will help early-stage projects keep these implications and possible solutions in mind when developing their own extension points. Weâd also like to get othersâ perspectives and comments on what we could have done differently, in the Q&amp;A session.</p>",

NPM registry is a network where most web developers upload their packages, this network has been shown to grow with time. The need to control these ecosystem dependencies is an active field in academia and industry. We present a VR city for analyzing the NPM dependencies of a node project with the goal of understanding the information about the licenses, vulnerabilities, community, and employment of the dependencies installed in order to detect and prevent issues derivated from there.</p>\n\n<p>For creating the VR scene in the browser, we will use BabiaXR, a toolset for data visualization in VR for the web, in this case, we will focus on the elevated city, being the buildings the packages installed by npm, and the level of the dependency represented as an elevated quarter of the city. In this talk, we will follow a step-by-step tutorial for retrieving the data and needed metrics and we will show how to use this VR scene and how to change these metrics in real time, updating the city in order to see information about the license usage, vulnerabilities, community or package employment.</p>\n\n<p>This talk requires basic knowledge of the NPM ecosystem, nothing else beyond that.</p>",

The Open Source Software community\nis very active in the development surrounding the Slurm ecosystem, contributing CLI tools for accounting, monitoring, and notebooks among others.

Therefore simplifying the creation of (containerised) environments by removing the burdens of maintaining config files, sensitive munge secrets, and additional daemons.</p>",
      "description": "<p>This talk will first provide an introduction to Slurm, followed by a description (mostly drawing from personal experience) of common patterns and pitfalls when creating containers that interact with Slurm clusters for different purposes (monitoring, notebooks, etc).\nNext, I will introduce Straw, explaining why it was needed and why despite its simplicity (it mostly just fetches a bunch of config files), it is able to perform a task that regular Slurm tools can't, therefore simplifying Slurm client environments.\nFinally, I will conclude by showing a simple example of how the tool can be used, and how it compares to the usual scenarios in which config files, extra daemons, and secrets need to be carefully managed.\nIf time allows it, I might detail some of the weaknesses of this approach: the fact that the Slurm protocol isn't really documented, and therefore this tool relies on \"reverse-engineering\" (as much as one can say reverse engineering when no documentation exists, but the code is available) to keep up with new Slurm releases.</p>",

Troika allows for a site-agnostic job script with directives, that can be translated to a script that the job submission system understands, based on configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Troika has been designed with extensibility in mind, to enable support for as many job submission systems as possible, as well as differences in the use of such systems. Troika is free software written in Python, exposing multiple entry points for hooks and plug-ins. It is a fundamental part of ECMWF's 24/7 time-critical operational and research workflows, making the glue between the batch scheduler and the workflow manager, where it handles hundreds of thousands of jobs each day.

      "title": "How to deal with validation as an HPC software?",
      "subtitle": "An approach to power software testing at scale",
      "abstract": "<p>Scientific Computing is constantly evolving, relying on technologies increasing in complexity. Codes produced in that field require testing and validation to assess their performance and reliability. This additional but inevitable task is often of low direct added value compared to the deployment costs. Yet multiple solutions dedicated to testings, including some HPC specific, are currently available -- our solution has unique specificities. \"Parallel Computing Validation System\" (PCVS) is an HPC-aware YAML-based job orchestration tool. It offers the unique capability of retargeting tests, decoupling benchmarks and execution environments. This way, it allows the same job set to be re-run to compare two standards without modifying test specifications. This validation set may be scaled automatically depending on available resources, whether the process runs on a single node (like a workstation) or a thousand-node supercomputer. Beyond a one-time shot, PCVS can log several successive executions of benchmarks for browsing, inspection, and post-processing through a dedicated Python interface. More than a metric, PCVS can build validation trends, providing better visualization to track project evolution, leading to better software quality.</p>",
      "description": "<p>In this presentation, we introduce PCVS, a powerful and user-friendly job orchestration tool designed to streamline and scale test workflows. Utilizing a simple and intuitive YAML syntax, PCVS allows for flexible and efficient scheduling of tests based on massively parallel resources. Our retargeting model allows for the remapping of benchmark workflows, commonly associated with compilation and execution phases, across multiple environments. This approach has been used to build an high-quality MPI evaluation system, higlighting differences between API support among multiple implementations, demonstrating the potential of PCVS to assess API/ABI support across different implementations. Initially designed for validation processing, PCVS is versatile and can handle a wide range of use cases, from single test directory to large cluster-wide application stack. It should be viewed not as a test framework but as a coordinator between existing test bases and supercomputers.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>We motivate and present an open-source benchmark suite for graph processing, created and maintained by the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC). We first define common graph workloads and the pitfalls of benchmarking systems that support them, then explain our guiding principles that allow for conducting meaningful benchmarks. We outline our open-source ecosystem that consists of a scalable graph generator (capable of producing property graphs with 100B+ edges) and benchmarks drivers with several reference implementations. Finally, we highlight the results of recent audited benchmark runs.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Data processing pipelines frequently involve graph computations: running complex path queries in graph databases, evaluating metrics for network science, training graph neural networks for classification, and so on. While graph technology has received significant attention in academia and industry, the performance of graph processing systems is often lacklustre, which hinders their adoption for large-scale problems.</p>\n\n<p>The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) was founded in 2012 by vendors and academic researchers with the aim of making graph processing performance measurable and comparable. To this end, LDBC provides open-source benchmark suites with openly available data sets starting at 1 GB and scaling up to 30 TB. Additionally, it allows vendors to submit their benchmark implementations to LDBC-certified auditors who ensure that the benchmark executions are reproducible and comply with the specification.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we describe three LDBC benchmarks: (1) the Graphalytics benchmark for offline graph analytics, (2) the Social Network Benchmark's Interactive workload for transactional graph database systems, and (3) the Business Intelligence workload for analytical graph data systems. For each benchmark, we explain how it ensures meaningful and interpretable results. Then, we summarize the main features of the benchmark drivers and list the current reference implementations (maintained by vendors and community members). Finally, we highlight recent audited benchmark results.</p>\n\n<p>Information on the talk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expected prior knowledge: specialized prior knowledge is not needed</li>\n<li>Intended audience: developers and users of graph processing frameworks</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Speakers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>GÃ¡bor SzÃ¡rnyas is a post-doctoral researcher at CWI Amsterdam.

This talk will discuss how GNUÂ Guix lets users deploy software optimized for the target machines while preserving provenance tracking and reproducibility.</p>\n\n<p>Why is HPC seen as antithetical to reproducibility in the first place? Maybe your cluster admins told you: if you want peak performance, you have to use the software stack that they themselves or the hardware vendors installed and tailored specifically to this cluster, and to recompile your code locally.  Your software deployment becomes tied to this machine and hardly reproducible elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>However, by giving up on reproducibility, we would give up on verifiability, a foundation of the scientific process.  How can we conciliate performance and reproducibility?  Engineering work that has gone into performance portability has already proved fruitful, but some areas remain unaddressed when it comes to CPU tuning.  This talk looks into package multi-versioning, a technique developed for GNUÂ Guix, a tool for reproducible software deployment.  We will show that it allows us to implement CPU tuning without compromising on reproducibility and provenance tracking.</p>",

As a result, high-performance LLVM-accelerated Python code may use MPI communication facilities without leaving the \"nopython\" mode (still being usable, e.g. for debugging purposes, with the JIT compilation disabled). The numba-mpi API constitutes a thin wrapper around the MPI C API and is built around the Numpy arrays including handling of non-contiguous views over Numpy array slices. The package is implemented in pure Python and depends on numpy, numba and mpi4py (the last dependency is used at initialisation only). Package releases are available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/p/numba-mpi/) and Conda Forge (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/numba-mpi). Project development is hosted at Github leveraging the mpi4py/setup-mpi workflow enabling continuous integration tests on Linux (MPICH, OpenMPI &amp; Intel MPI), macOS (MPICH &amp; OpenMPI) and Windows (MS MPI). Auto-generated docstring-based API docs are maintained at: https://numba-mpi.github.io/numba-mpi.

      "title": "Running MPI applications on Toro unikernel",
      "abstract": "<p>Unikernels aims at improving the way single purpose systems are built with minimalist kernels that the userâs application compiles within. This results in deployments that require less memory, less disk, less cpu and less time to be up and running. Also, the whole system spends most of the time in the user application or doing IO for that single application thus cpu time is used more efficiently. In this presentation, we talk about the use of unikernels for High Performance Computing. We present a work-in-progress that aims at implementing the MPI standard on top of Toro, an open-source non-POSIX unikernel. In this work, we implement a library that conforms to the Open MPI implementation. This library relies on Toro API to implement the MPI functions. In particular, the library leverages Toroâs features like per-CPU memory allocation, cooperative scheduler, thread migration and inter-core communication based on Virtio. During the initialization, Toro creates one instance of the MPI application per core. Each instance is a thread that is migrated to the corresponding core and then executes without any interference. When applications are required to allocate memory, each core has its own memory pool from where memory is allocated. This allows us to keep memory allocation local, thus improving the way cache is used. Also, primitives like MPI<em>Gather() or MPI</em>Scatter() that require communication between instances are implemented by relying on a new Virtio device named virtio-bus that allows core-to-core communication without locking. At the moment, we have implemented the following APIs:\n- MPI<em>Gather()\n- MPI</em>Scatter()\n- MPI<em>Reduce()\n- MPI</em>Barrier()\nThe goal of this PoC is to port benchmarks from the osu-microbenchmarking (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/) to compare with existing implementations. During the presentation, we present how this is implemented and we demonstrate the use of the current implementation by executing different MPI applications on top of Toro.</p>",

To that end, we developed the LLVM\ncompiler plugin TypeART.

      "description": "<p>In general, MUSTâs correctness checking includes errors that already manifest - segmentation faults or incorrect results\n- and many errors that are invisible to the developer or only manifest with certain HPC systems and MPI libraries. MUST\nworks by intercepting MPI calls of a target application at runtime, allowing for bookkeeping of the current program state.\nThus, MUST can cope with the complex MPI semantics of, e.g., (a) collectives, (b) wildcards, or (c) datatypes.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence of relying on intercepting MPI calls, though, MUST is unaware of the effective type of the allocated void*\nbuffers used for the low-level MPI API. To that end, TypeART was developed to track memory (de-) allocation relevant to\nMPI communication. TypeART instruments heap, stack and global variable allocations with a callback to our runtime.\nThe callback consists of (a) the memory address, (b) the type-layout information of the allocation (built-ins, user-defined\nstructs etc.) and (c) number of elements. Thus, with TypeART, MUST can check for type compatibility between the type-\nless MPI communication buffer and the declared MPI datatype.

      "subtitle": "An LLVM based approach",
      "abstract": "<p>Code instrumentation is the primary means for extracting fine-grained performance data from programs. However, special\ncare has to be taken to with regard to overhead management, as a full instrumentation can increase the runtime by orders\nof magnitude. Careful selection of the instrumentation configuration (IC), typically via filter lists, is therefore crucial to retain\nthe performance characteristics of the original application. In order to give the user better control of what is measured, we\nhave developed CaPI, an open-source tool for the creation of low-overhead, user-defined ICs. CaPI relies on a statically\nconstructed whole-program call-graph as its central data structure, enabling the user to select functions based on the\ncontext they are called in, in addition to function-level metrics. Currently, this call-graph is generated externally by tools\nrunning on the source level. This can be cumbersome, especially when targeting large-scale scientific software.\nTo mitigate this issue, we are developing an approach that runs the analysis on the LLVM intermediate representation\nduring link-time optimization. Running during link-time also allows us to embed the result into the binary, improving the\nworkflow and usability of CaPI. In this talk we will discuss the advantages and shortcomings of link time generated call\ngraphs compared to source level generated call graphs, and show how statically generated information can be augmented\ndynamically at runtime.</p>",

      "title": "How the Spack package manager tames the stat storm",
      "abstract": "<p>In high performance computing, package managers like Nix, Guix, Gentoo Prefix, and Spack are used to install applications and their dependencies. They allow multiple variants and flavors of the same package to coexist, by installing every package into a unique prefix directory that embeds a hash derived from the dependency graph.</p>\n\n<p>This non-standard directory structure can result in increased startup time of executables, as the dynamic linker has to search through many directories to locate all required libraries. This is especially problematic in the context of HPC and shared filesystems, since many instances of the same executable may start in parallel, causing a \"stat storm\" on the typically slow filesystem.</p>\n\n<p>This talk explores benefits and drawbacks of different solutions, and shows in particular how the Spack package manager solves this problem.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The Spack package manager is widely used by HPC sites, users, and developers to install HPC software, and the Spack project began offering a public binary cache in June of 2022.  The cache includes builds for x86_64, Power, and aarch64, as well as for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and Intel's oneapi compiler.  Currently, the system handles nearly 40,000 builds per week to maintain a core set of Spack packages.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping this many different stacks working continuously has been a challenge, and this talk will dive into the build infrastructure we use to make it happen.  Spack is hosted on GitHub, but the CI system is orchestrated by GitLab CI in the cloud. Builds are automated and triggered by pull requests, with runners both in the cloud and on bare metal.  We will talk about the architecture of the CI system, from the user-facing stack descriptions in YAML to backend services like Kubernetes, Karpenter, S3, CloudFront, and the challenges of tuning runners to give good build performance.  We'll also talk about how we've implemented security in a completely PR-driven CI system, and the difficulty of serving all the relevant HPC platforms when most commits are from untrusted contributors.  Finally, we'll talk about some of the architectural decisions in Spack itself that had to change to better support CI.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Testing applications intended to run on high-performance computing clusters can be a painful process, especially when you do not have access to the resources you need. Sometimes you just want to check if you have the right compile flag specified, if the script you wrote actually works, or if your application can successfully use multiple cores. One way to test your HPC software is by <em>emulation</em>; instead of wasting precious compute time on your bare-metal cluster, you use a micro-HPC cluster that provides the same functionality as the bare-metal cluster on a smaller scale.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will discuss the concept and implementation of an open-source testing framework that builds upon micro-HPC clusters. We will explore how a micro-HPC cluster can be brought up using Python and deploy core software such as identity management, shared file systems, and environment modules. We will also be exploring the transferability of the testing framework, such as how we can ensure that tests can both be run in CI pipelines and on local development machines, or how can use pre-existing frameworks such as pytest or unittest to run the tests. Lastly, we will discuss limitations of the testing framework and future work that can be done to improve its capabilities.</p>",

Attendees are encouraged to experiment with and hack on the device both at the conference and afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>This year at EMFCamp 2022, the conference badge was a USB thumb drive sized ESP32 device running MicroPython. It has a joystick, an accelerometer, the cutest little LiPo battery, and a lovely 135x240 pixel colour TFT display. It seemed like it would be a fun single-weekend exercise to write a little 3D renderer for it in Python.</p>\n\n<p>It turned out to be a \"fun\" multi-weekend exercise, but I learned a lot that I'd like to share. I learned how to workaround problems in the tooling. I learned there were problems in the display driver. I learned about optimising Python. I learned how to write native MicroPython modules to rewrite some hot functions in C. I learned about optimising how the Python talks to the C. And I even learned how to contribute some improvements back to the MicroPython project.</p>\n\n<p>I will bring the device with me, catch me after the talk to see it rendering Utah teapots up close.</p>",

It is trying to be as Pythonic as possible and relies on exceptions, type hints and decorators with a strong focus on composition over inheritance to make its implementation fully customizable.</p>",

We will assume no piror knowledge about it.</p>",
      "description": "<h2>Details</h2>\n\n<p>Since the launch of Pyscript there are a lot of questions about what is it and how it works. Will it change how we do web development with Python? In this talk, we will go through what Pyscirpt actually is, and how it works (using compared Python libraries on Pyodides). We will also talk about why Pyscript is created - not to take over JavaScript or Django, but to give the rest of 99% of people access to Python.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we will also showcase how to use PyScript with JavaScript and/ or Django, hopefully, to inspire Python web developers to try it out.</p>\n\n<h2>Outline</h2>\n\n<p>Introduction (5 mins)\nWhat is pyscript (5 mins)\nHow to use pyscript (5 mins)\nUsing pyscript with JavaScript (5 mins)\nUsing pyscript with Django (5 mins)\nConclusion (5 mins)</p>",

It publishes a static website where users find a navigation, online search and linked pages, with the option to group everything by component versions.</p>\n\n<p>In 2022, Antora made the leap to open its publishing process to plugins: They allow pulling information dynamically during the build process and forward the content not only to a static HTML site, but other targets like PDF as well. This talk outlines what is possible today with these extensions, and how it can be extended for custom needs.</p>",

For developers it is normal to develop software in collaboration using their IDE and a version control system like Git. The same type of collaboration is possible when all documentation is versioned in a markup-format like AsciiDoc.</p>\n\n<p>Several examples will be from the Eclipse Che project which leveraged the Antora extensions in 2022. Additional examples show how to enrich the content with metadata and to use the information when building the site, and how to get feedback from the users of the site.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>I wanted a secure and convenient way to share baby photos with friends and family, so I used Matrix to create an app with a social network interface and end-to-end encryption underneath.  In this talk, I describe how we use Matrix rooms to represent human social structures, from loose disorganized circles of friends, to well-defined organized groups.  I will talk about what worked well, where we found some pain points, and what we did to work around them.</p>",
      "description": "<p>I wanted the security of Signal Private Messenger together with the convenience of Facebook.  So I created an app called Circles that uses Matrix as its server.  All posts are end-to-end encrypted, so even the server admins can't read what users post or look at their pictures.</p>\n\n<p>In Matrix, everything happens in a room.  So Circles uses Matrix rooms to store all of its posts.  We use Matrix rooms in two different ways to let users connect and share in an organic way.</p>\n\n<p>First, we can use a Matrix room to store one individual user's own posts, similar to their \"wall\" in Facebook.  The user can invite other users to follow them by joining the room.  Followers can also post emoji reactions and replies to the room owner's posts.  In the app, a social \"circle\" consists of one such \"wall\" room belonging to the current user, plus similar \"wall\" rooms belonging to the user's friends.  For example, Alice's \"Friends\" circle might consist of her own \"Friends\" room, her buddy Bob's \"Friends\" room, and their friend Carol's \"Friends\" room.  The app hides most of the complexity of the multiple rooms and instead presents the user with a single unified timeline of posts collated from all the rooms in the circle.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we can use a single Matrix room to represent a social group (like a Facebook group) where everyone in the group knows each other.  All that is required here is to render Matrix messages as a timeline of \"social\" posts rather than as chat messages.</p>\n\n<p>We estimate that building on Matrix saved us 18-24 months of development time for our first minimum viable prototype.  Overall the experience has been very good.</p>\n\n<p>However, we did run into a few pain points.  These include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Decryption errors with the iOS SDK</li>\n<li>Needing two passphrases to enable secure server-side storage, or hoping that the user never loses their first device</li>\n<li>Problems with the 3rd party identity server that we initially used for email verification</li>\n<li>No ability to post both text and media in the same message</li>\n<li>No ability to give a new user access to the earliest encrypted posts in the room</li>\n<li>Questions about server performance and scalability</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>To address #2 and #3, we built a new authentication service using the Matrix user-interactive authentication API.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking forward to upcoming improvements in the Matrix spec, including extensible events, rooms as profiles, and sliding sync.</p>",

      "subtitle": "Building an open-source HP48-like calculator",
      "abstract": "<p>The DB48X project aims at recreating an open-source implementation of Reverse Polish Lisp on modern calculator platforms</p>",
      "description": "<p>In 1986, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP28C, and with it, a new programming language, \"Reverse Polish Lisp\" (RPL). This was arguably one of the most powerful programming languages ever introduced on a pocket calculator, and it continued well into the 2000's, with the HP50 series. RPL was initially designed for a machine with a 4-bit CPU and 2K of memory, soon upgraded to 32K. Some of the more recent calculators from Hewlett-Packard used ARM CPUs, but then only to emulate the original 4-bit CPU and run the older 4-bit ROM code.</p>\n\n<p>Today, several ARM-based calculator platforms support open-source firmware. This opens the possibility to revive RPL in a more modern environment. DB48X is an attempt at recreating RPL from scratch to run on such platforms. Even today, these machines remain minimalistic, with as little as 60K of free memory and less than 1MB of usable Flash storage, for example. This talk will present a design and implementation of a basic RPL runtime written in C++, but replacing the standard C++ object model with a compact, garbage-collected, byte-addressable representation of RPL objects. We will also dive into what RPL is, why it truly deserves the name \"Lisp\", and why it remains remarkably different from the Lisp most of us are familiar with. We will discuss some of the implemented and planned features for that new iteration of RPL, including built-in on-line help, taking advantage of high-resolution graphics, or making it as efficient as possible in \"direct\" (non-programmed) mode.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>GitHub is an extremely popular but proprietary git hosting service used by many free software projects. As a free software developer, do you wish to move to your own fully self-hosted git hosting service? Are you unable to do so because you find the GitHub issue tracker and website building features too convenient and useful? Are you frustrated with free software issue trackers and git hosting tools that require too much setup? Then, tissue is the minimalist issue tracker and project management system you've been waiting for!</p>\n\n<p>With tissue, you write issues as free-form text in gemtext files and commit them into the git repo of your project. tissue comes with an excellent Xapian based search interface that lets you search through these issues using very natural and powerful queries. tissue comes with an easily self-hosted web interface, and even helps you with building a static site to show off your project. State is evil. So, apart from the project git repo, tissue is stateless. The web interface does not require a database. This makes it easy to deploy, backup, and is at the right level of complexity for small free software projects.</p>\n\n<p>tissue is written in the delightful GNU Guile, if that's important to you!</p>",
