Turbo: The speed of a single-page web application without having to write any JavaScript 

1. Build an app that displays events. Has some space above and below the list (maybe) with pagination. Disable Turbo
2. Enable turbo - pretty nice
3. Add search box. Show that it loses focus on search
4. Add a JS line now?
5. Permanent.
6. Frame [?]

Load fosdem events all for searching 2023. Also needs descriptions.


For server-side demo: enable GPRS throttling.
Also shows the navigation icon.

END:
- hope you found it intriguing
- part 2 possible with more advanced features, such as streaming / broadcasting updates

I want to show that:
- it's fast (search, maybe over the server show too?)
- it's easy (no JS at all ideal)
- it's powerful

Not some general way of building applications.

Turbo:
Drive
Frames?
Streams??

Some slides too:
There's no cleint side:
- state
- router

Maybe show how form submit happens, that button is switched to disabled.
422 thingy or 303 (show it in action)

Frames as a trick for browser edit is not a good idea it seems -> the main reasons for frames are caching, parallization => not sure if worthy. They also generally shouldn't change URL if I understand correctly.

How it works:
- intercepts link clicks and form submits (show in browser)
- replaces body keeps the head (already a benefit)

animation.
popover?

Frames allow you to replace just part of the page
- how to show it? => example with paging and search?
- show some errors if not matching frame

But wait, there's more: morph 
- merged last week 
- how to best show it, where it shines? -> multiple distinct regions. => broadcast no...
--> only with refresh visit (what does it mean?) -> when turbo renders the same page again
--> actually mostly for scroll position?
--> benefits: focus, text selection, scroll + broadcasting action as an alternative to sending individual stream updates (before, after, etc.) => maybe here shine an example?

Turbo refresh scroll works on its own, without morph. When page URL changes it's not morph.
Morph only on replace and when URL didn't change or when from cache



Central question for the future: decide what is server-side and what is client side. 

IDEA: input.isDirty could be taken into account when morphing
isDirty obtained by comparing value and defaultValue.

Hypothesis about frames / streams:
- state should be stored on the server, so:
  - forms should be generated there and show with JS
  - or they should be generated based on server state: e.g. params, session 
  	- perhaps even some specialized store only for this path, or try with flash?
OH shit:
- form value is replacing with old on morph.
- js-based show will also be replaced in morph.

Goal of the talk is to teach.
Present turbo, try to avoid streams and frames. 

Perhaps modals example? (search)




IDEA: show with Turbo 8 disabled, and discover what problems we will hit.

Maybe a demo at the end with other uses:
- search
- navigating table while graph above is visible

Autocomplete for Tailwind doesn't work.	
Maybe no tailwind and just CSS, since it lacks even basic styling and can be confsing -> but then ugly.

App idea:
table
with paging
search

Prepare seed in advance (cheat)
Everything else from scratch or is it too much?
Use resources generator

Pagination: simple
How to do search? Simple by name
Maybe add some more props, like speaker.

Alpha order.
Next-Prev at the bottom

Maybe add this BO first, to train with it?

bonus: JS to 


Practical Introduction to Turbo
from zero to hero

IDEAS:
- Table with paging and search
	- small, even pagination is already nice
	- people can relate to this stuff
	- search more complicated
	- input is not deleting => nice
	- scroll show by adding more elements on the page: morph shines; maybe even set the second setting separately.

- Graph with transitions?
	- or maybe Graph above a table show to see how interactive it is? (<= good idea)

- Some CRUD -> try to modify https://www.hotrails.dev? 
	- similar to the tutorial online, but with 8?
	- will still require frames, perhaps good?
	- trick with IDs for each element to morph to work when adding? dom_id can be used?
	- maybe multi-edit will work if I have frames everywhere
	- multi-edit on array is a weird use case, better present it as multiple distinct fields edit.
